Her initiation into that gilded world is a story unto itself_ but then it all starts to fall apart around her as the revolution begins. The tale of sacrifice and struggle (and a touch of romance) is undiluted by the fantasy elements in the novel.

Perhaps that should not be surprising_ for since the time of G. K. Chesterton those who have explored stories with a religious belief or background have tended to place them in the Middle Ages. And during that time most Christians were in one way or another connected to the Catholic church. From Chesterton?s classic priest-turned-detective Father Brown to Peter Tremayne?s historical Celtic nun and lawyer_ Sister Fidelma_ religious men and women put aside their professional duties for a moment to take up an altogether different vocation for a short time?that of detective and solver of crimes unspeakable.

Master of the Five Magics,"Fiction_Fantasy_Paranormal Powers_Wizards, Sorcerers, Enchantresses. Etc.","To master five greats arts of magic and win a queen was not enough for Alodar the apprentice. He must do what no man dared! 

Alodar was a mere apprentice thaumaturge_ learning the least of the five great arts of magic. As such_ h had no right to aspire to the hand of the fair lady_ Queen Vendora_ not even when he saved her during demon-inspired seige of her frontier castle. But aspire he did.

His quest forced him from one exacting branch of magic to another_ with the rewards he earned always going to others. Finally_ only the branch of wizardry remained - the great_ almost lost art of controlling demons.

It was then he learned of the ancient plot behind his rise - and faced the greatest danger any man could dare!

Alodar's quest is not only a stirring tale of adventure_ but also one of the most logical detailings of the laws of magic ever to appear in fantasy."
Blood Price,Fiction_Fantasy_Horror_Detective,"Set in Toronto_ Ontario_ Canada. This book follows the courageous and hard-headed Vicki Nelson_ a private investigator_ formerly of Toronto's homicide detail. 
As she delves into a series of seemingly unstoppable murders_ she teams up with a writer of romance novels_ Henry Fitzroy_ but there's more to him than meets the eye (as Vicki's suspicious on-again-off-again boyfriend_ Det. Mike Celluci suspects)but Fitzroy is not an ordinary man at all_ for he is a vampire."
Daughter of the Blood,Fiction_Fantasy_Sword and Sorcery,"The world of the Black Jewels Trilogy is one filled with magic_ governed by Queens and their courts of powerful Warlords. Over the recent centuries_ a slow creeping taint has filled the Realm of Light. Strong-willed_ deeply magical warlords have been warped and repressed by a witch who hopes to harness them to her tainted cause_ until they perpetuate the very corruption they fear. The High Lord of Hell is the only one strong enough (and free enough) to overcome her_ but he's over 50_000 years old and tired of unlife. 

A prophesy from a half-crazed witch declares that the Dark Queen is coming_ she who can cleanse all the realms. And she does come_ 700 years after her foretelling. She'll fulfill the wishes of countless dreamers-- if they can keep her safe from the taint long enough to reach her full power. Otherwise_ she'll be the embodiment of all their nightmares."
The Awakening Water,Fiction_Children & Young Adult_Science_Future,"Thirteen-year-old John has never questioned his life of back-breaking work for the District Leader-- until the day he meets the wild girl and tastes the forbidden water. Cool_ clear spring water_ utterly unlike the sickly liquid John has always known_ it gives him a new aliveness_ awakens him to both hope and fear... and impells him to escape.

He joins others who have fled from the Party_ and with them he develops an awareness of himself_ of other people_ and of the world around him. The more he learns about the ways the Party has ""kept everyone quiet and working"" since it came to power in 1997_ the more precarious his new-found freedom seems--and the more precious.

A sort of ""1984"" for children and young adults_ though grown-ups can enjoy it as well."
March to the Stars,Fiction_Science_Adventure_Militaristic,"Roger Ramius Sergei Alexander Chiang MacClintock has had a really bad year. 

Bad enough to be the spoiled rotten fop of a prince no one wanted or trusted.


Worse to be sent off on a meaningless diplomatic mission_ simply to get you out from underfoot_ with a bodyguard of Marines who loathe and despise you.


Worse yet to be assumed dead and marooned for almost a year on a hell-hole planet while you and those same Marines fight your way through carnivorous beasts_ murderous natives_ and perpetual rain to the only starport. . . which is controlled by the Empire's worst enemies.


Worst of all to have discovered that you were born to be a warrior prince. One whose bodyguards have learned the same lesson. And one haunted by the deaths of almost a hundred of your Marines... for what you know now was an unnecessary exercise in political expediency.


A warrior prince who wants to have a few choice words with your Lady Mother_ the Empress of Man.


But to have them_ you_ your surviving Marines_ and your Mardukan allies must cross a demon-haunted ocean_ face a civilization that is ""civilized"" in name alone and ""barbarians"" who may not be exactly what they seem_ and once again battle against impossible odds. All so that you can attempt to somehow seize a heavily defended spaceport and hijack a starship to take you home.


Yet what neither Roger_ nor the Marines_ nor his allies know is that the battle to leave Marduk is only the beginning. And that words with Roger's mother will be hard to come by.


But that's all right. Because what the Galaxy doesn't know is that it's about to receive a fresh proof of an old truism:


You don't mess with a MacClintock."
Dial-a-Ghost,Fiction_Children & Young Adult_Horror,"The Dial-a-Ghost Agency finds good homes for ghosts.  Bloodstained brides_ headless warriors_ bloblike ghouls-ghosts of every sort are matched with living families.  There are two doors to the agency's offices: one marked GHOSTS_ the other marked PEOPLE.  Through the first door come the Wilkinsons_ a nice family of spooks who are fed up with haunting a knicker shop (the lacy slips and rudely named tights are not good for ghost children to be around!).  Through the second door comes Fulton Snodde-Brittle_ who wants the wickedest ghosts available for his grand home_ Helton Hall. 

Luckily the agency ladies_ Miss Pringle and Mrs. Mannering_ have just the right match for each customer.  They send the Wilkinsons off to a tranquil old abbey and promise Fulton Snodde-Brittle a pair of appalling spooks_ the Shriekers_ who wear rotten meat as jewelry and like to strangle children in their sleep.  What the kindly ladies don't know is that Fulton has an evil scheme to frighten his young cousin_ the heir to Hulton Hall_ to death.  Poor Oliver doesn't stand a chance against the Shriekers_ but maybe the agency isn?t as well organized as it seems."
The Magic Circle,Fairy Tales & Folklore_Reinterpretations,Deep in the woods lives an old witch called Ugly One.  All she wants is to forget-that she once was a loving mother and healer_ blessed and powerful within her magic circle_ and not a witch_ claimed by the devils.  Then one day she hears the footsteps she dreads.  Then real voices-children?s voices.  The Ugly One longs to take care of sturdy_ sensible Gretel and her young brother Hansel.  They are such good children_ such delicious_ beautiful children.  But demon?s voices scream in her head: ?Eat them!? How can she?...How can she not?
Darkchild,Fiction_Science_Fantasy,For these hundred centuries_ women of wisdom and strength have mastered the sunstones to bring warmth and wealth to their people. But while the Brakrathi tended their stonehalls and valleys_ others have traversed the spaces between the stars with less gentle motives. Like the arrogant Arnini_ who study and measure eveything but understand nothing of the human soul.

Oxford Book of American Detective Stories,Fiction_Crime_Mystery_Detective_General,"Edited by: Tony Hillerman and Rosemary Herbert

Edgar Allan Poe's ""Murders in the Rue Morgue"" launched the detective story in 1841. The genre began as a highbrow form of entertainment_ a puzzle to be solved by a rational sifting of clues. In Britain_ the stories became decidedly upper crust: the crime often committed in a world of manor homes and formal gardens_ the blood on the Persian carpet usually blue. But from the beginning_ American writers worked important changes on Poe's basic formula_ especially in use of language and locale.

In The Oxford Book of American Detective Stories_ Tony Hillerman and Rosemary Herbert bring together thirty-three tales that illuminate both the evolution of crime fiction in the United States and America's unique contribution to this highly popular genre. From elegant ""locked room"" mysteries_ to the hard-boiled realism of the '30s and '40s_ to the great range of styles seen today_ this superb collection includes the finest crime writers_ including Erle Stanley Gardner_ Raymond Chandler_ Ross Macdonald_ Rex Stout_ Ellery Queen_ Ed McBain_ Sue Grafton_ and Hillerman_ a best-selling crime writer himself. And we sample a wide variety of styles_ from tales with a strongly regional flavor_ to hard-edged pulp fiction_ to stories with a feminist perspective.

Throughout_ the editors provide highly knowledgeable introductions to each piece_ written from the perspective of fellow writers and reflecting a life-long interest--not to say love--of this quintessentially American genre. Hillerman and Herbert bring us a gold mine of glorious stories that can be read for sheer pleasure_ but that also illuminate how the crime story evolved from the drawing room to the back alley_ and how it came to explore every corner of our nation and every facet of our lives.

Sunset at Blandings,Fiction_General_Humor,"This joyful_ inexhaustibly funny story will be as precious to the many thousands of Wodehouse readers as would a permanent record of the last night of the best-loved and longest-running comedy the world will ever know. Sunset at Blandings is P.G. Wodehouse's last and unfinished novel.

We believe the book to be a delight for the sake of the novel alone. It runs in Wodehouse's text to the end of the sixteenth chapter of a planned twenty-two chapters. But in other respects too will it be treasured by Wodehouse devotees. The book contains a selection of the author's own working notes_ of his first hand-written draft for the book_ and of his detailed notes on the final stages of the plot. Here_ then_ is an opportunity to see at first hand the meticulous craft of the master.

And how is it at Blandings in the end? A niece is incarcerated. Galahad smuggles in her beloved_ a penniless artist_ to paint the Empress and at last it seems that senior pig will be hung in the Gallery. The Chancellor of the Exchequer comes to stay_ shadowed even on the croquet lawn by an escort from the Yard. And what of Lord Emsworth? He has drawn upon the utmost ounce of his resolution and put a brand new sister to flight_ and we take our leave of him -- and of Beach and Gally and the others -- bringing down the curtain on the happiest of all sagas_ in absolute command of his Castle."
Mac Flecknoe,Poetry_Humorous,"""A Satire upon the True-blue Protestant Poet T.S.""  Included in The Top 500 Poems."
The Jade Peony,Fiction_Historical_Other,In this remarkable first novel_ three young children ? a sister and her two brothers ? come of age in an immigrant Chinese family in Vancouver during the early 1940s. Intertwined with the stories of the children are the experiences of their elders_ Old Wong and Poh-Poh. Side by side_ the five family members survive the hardships and heartbreaks with grit and humor_ discovering a new land without forgetting their common ground.
The Umbrella Man and Other Stories,Fiction_Crime_Mystery_Suspense_Fantasy_Contemporary,"What could be wrong with a sweet-tempered landlady who offers the cheapest_ cleanest_ coziest quarters? Ask any of her tenants--if you can dig one up. Before Roald Dahl became a master of stories for children_ he was a master of the adult short story. His several popular anthologies were noted for the ingenuity and surprising humanity with which he could combine seemingly everyday characters_ good intentions_ and dark deeds into immensely satisfying tales. These stories_ specifically collected for teen readers_ grab you from the start_ hold you fast--and then throw all your expectations out the window with surprise twist endings. By turns macabre_ hilarious_ and touching_ these stories are filled with unexpected delights and the always-expected Dahl brilliance.

The first two are Jeeves stories from the 1920's; ""Fixing It for Freddie"" is a rewriting of the Reggie Pepper story ""Helping Freddie""."
The Inimitable Jeeves,Fiction_General_Humor,"This is a sort of novel_ as there is a definite progression in time_ with events carrying over from one chapter to the next. However_ many of the chapters could stand alone as short stories with a little encouragement_ and in fact did so previously to being sequed into the book. Other stories are broken up into two chapters; these may be read in their original form in The World of Jeeves. The chapters are as follows:

"Carry on, Jeeves",Fiction_General_Humor,"From the moment Jeeves glides into Bertie Wooster's life and provides him with a magical hangover cure_ Bertie begins to wonder how he's ever managed without him. Jeeves makes himself totally indispensable in every way_ disentangling the hapless Bertie from scrapes with formidable aunts_ madcap girls and unbidden guests. His ability to dig assorted fellows out of sundry holes is nothing short of miraculous. In short_ the man is a paragon.

"Right Ho, Jeeves",Fiction_General_Humor,Bertie asks Jeeves to help Gussie Fink-Nottle capture the affections of Madeline Bassett_ but disagrees with his methods_ which involve dressing Gussie up in tights and a false beard. But when Bertie's own ill-laid plan gangs agley_ he must turn to Jeeves again to bring the hapless couple together_ even if it means giving up his latest sartorial acquisition.U.S. title: Brinkley Manor
"Thank You, Jeeves",Fiction_General_Humor,Bertie Wooster retires to a cottage in the country without the assistance of his right-hand man_ Jeeves_ but after a period of lively adventure_ during which the cottage is destroyed by fire_ Bertie returns to London_ accompanied once more by the invaluable Jeeves.
The Code of the Woosters,Fiction_General_Humor,Wodehouse?s most famous creations_ likeable nitwit Bertie Wooster and his effortlesly superior valet and protector Jeeves_ reach a kind of apotheosis in The Code of the Woosters_ in which Bertie is rescued from his bumbling escapades again and again by the ever-nonplussed gentleman?s gentleman Jeeves.
Joy in the Morning,Fiction_General_Humor,"Trapped in rural Steeple Bumpleigh_ a man less stalwart than Bertie Wooster would probably have given way at the knees.For among those present were Florence Cray_ to whom Bertie had once been engaged... and her new fianc� ""Stilton"" Cheesewright_ who regarded Bertie as a snake in the grass... also Zenobia Hopwood and her guardian Lord Worplesdon_ whose violent antipathy to ""Boko"" Fittleworth amounted to obsession... and that biggest blot on the landscape_ Edwin the Boy Scout doing acts of kindness out of sheer malevolence.All Bertie's forebodings were fully justified. For in his efforts to oil the wheels of commerce_ promote the course of true love and avoid the consequences of a vendetta_ he became the prey of all and sundry.Complete disaster might well have followed_ but for the genius of Jeeves - who extricated the young master with a ploy as smoothly executed as it was brilliantly conceived."
The Mating Season,Fiction_General_Humor,"When Bertie Wooster visits Deverill Hall pretending to be Gussie Fink-Nottle he finds himself in trouble. To begin with_ there is the case of Esmond Haddock_ JP_ the squire of King's Deverill_ and his surging sea of Aunts. Then there is the problem with ""Corky"" Pirbright_ Constable Dobbs and the dog. 
Complicating Matters further_ Esmond is in love with Corky_ and Esmond's cousin Gertrude with Corky's brother_ but the aunts have forbidden both unions. And_ as if that were not enough_ Gussie arrives in person pretending to be Bertie. There is only one person who can save Bertie from a fate worse than death-so naturally_ Jeeves materializes at Deverill pretendting to be someone else. 

All quite clear? This is another hilarious Wodehouse romp!"
Ring for Jeeves,Fiction_General_Humor,Jeeves suggests a small bottle of champagne in the library. Bertie Wooster's happiness seems to know no bounds until destiny comes in through the French window. When confusion and panic reign_ disaster can be averted . . . if you ring for Jeeves.
Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit,Fiction_General_Humor,It was Bertie Wooster's opinion that his new moustache would do something for him. It was Jeeves' opinion that it did indeed do something for him. Something unmentionable. A certain coolness between them was bound to result. Against this stormy_ Wuthering Heights sort of background a giant drama begins to unfold_ involving_ among other things_ Bertie's possession of a stolen necklace_ and the soul-shattering prospect of a trip to the marriage altar. The imperturbable Jeeves rallies to the cause and preempts the part usually reserved for the United States Marines_ thus aiding Bertie_ who gets himself out of more than one complication in his feckless life.
Jeeves in the Offing,Fiction_General_Humor,also known as How Right You Are_ Jeeves
"Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves",Fiction_General_Humor,Wild horses?which have such an undeserved reputation for wanting to drag one off to unpleasant places?could not have coerced a sane Bertram Wooster to return again to Totleigh Towers_ seat of the Bertram-hating Sir Watkyn Basset. Particularly not with that petite young ass_ Stiffy Byng_ expecting him to act a part in one of her infernal schemes. Yet there was the matter of Gussie Fink-Nottle_ whose ardor for the soppy Madeline Basset had been observed to be definitely waning. The problem was that_ if Gussie should escape the ties that bind_ Madeline was more than likely to loose the fountains of her pity and settle on Bertie?whom she assumed erroneously to be pining for her?in the manner of one of those sea-maidens_ the What-you-may-call-ems_ that fasten onto drowning sailors and drag them to their doom. Yes_ it was imperative that the course of true love between M. Basset and G. Fink-Nottle be put smooth again_ even if it meant hurling the Wooster honour once more into_ ah_ whatever it is one hurls oneself into. . .starts with a b.

To top it all_ he was staying with Aunt Dahlia whose house party included two former fianc�es with designs upon his future.It was a calamitous situation for which there could be only one solution: Jeeves.

Assigned to immerse himself in the life of Private John Trow_ Steven soon finds that his weekends at the living history village on Connecticut's Mt. Riga let him escape his everyday disappointments. The complex drills of the Union army seem to come to him naturally_ the men of the regiment become his friends_ and his growing infatuation with Polly Kellogg_ the wife of the regiment's captain_ fires a passion that had cooled with his own wife. While the world around him races faster and faster toward the millennium_ Steven turns to the simple consolations of nineteenth-century life_ a choice that_ strangely enough_ starts to straighten out both his family and his job. But so thoroughly does Steven embrace the life of John Trow that even Steven begins to wonder if he is just playing a part_ or whether the unquiet spirit of John Trow is taking him over. As Steven's identity slips through his fingers_ he must ask himself what - and who - he is willing to sacrifice to become the man he believes he should have been.

Left behind on picket duty to guard their army's flank_ the soldiers decide to relax with a baseball and bat_ when_ as if by magic_ a company of Alabama infantry appears from the woods.

These two parts of the book were originally separate serials in The Captain: ""Jackson Junior"" and ""The Lost Lambs""."
Psmith in the City,Fiction_General_Humor,"""It would ill beseem me_ Comrade Jackson_"" said Psmith_ thoughtfully sipping his coffee_ ""to run down the metropolis of a great and friendly nation_ but candor compels me to state that New York is in some respects a singularly blighted town."" ""What's the matter with it?"" asked Mike. ""Too decorous_ Comrade Jackson. I came over here principally_ it is true_ to be at your side_ should you be in any way persecuted by scoundrels. But at the same time I confess that at the back of my mind there lurked a hope that stirring adventures might come my way. I had heard so much of the place. Report had it that an earnest seeker after amusement might have a tolerably spacious rag in this modern Byzantium. . . ."""
"Psmith, Journalist",Fiction_General,"Having accompanied Mike to New York City_ Psmith lands a job at Cosy Moments magazine_ and persuades editor Billy Windsor to turn it into a muckraking journal. Their expos� of slum tenements elicits a bribe offer from the gangster landlord_ but ""Cozy Moments cannot be muzzled_"" says Psmith_ and the landlord must make more strenuous efforts to discourage them.
There is a comma in the title_ but for some reason it is absent from the covers of most editions_ and the novel seems to be better known without it. The U.S. version of a completely different Wodehouse novel_ The Prince and Betty_ incorporated part of the original magazine serialization of Psmith_ Journalist; in it Psmith is renamed Smith and is evidently a minor character_ which would undoubtably distress him_ had he any way of knowing. The U.K. version of the novel did not incorporate the Smith material."
Enter Psmith,Fiction_General_Humor,"Chapters 30 to 59 of Mike_ published as a separate novel in 1935; renamed Mike and Psmith in 1953_ when published consecutively with Mike at Wrykyn_ the first 29 chapters. The material was originally serialized in The Captain Magazine as ""The Lost Lambs"".""At the end of the first part of Mike_ the hero_ Mike Jackson_ is removed from Wrykyn to the inferior establishment of Sedleigh_ and on his first day there he meets Psmith_ likewise a new boy_ superannuated from Eton. From this point onwards Psmith dominates the scene. . ."""
Mike and Psmith,Fiction_General_Humor,"This is the second part of Mike_  part of the 1909 edition of that novel_ originally run as a separate serial_ ""The Lost Lambs"" in The Captain Magazine.  ""At the end of the first part of Mike_ the hero_ Mike Jackson_ is removed from Wrykyn to the inferior establishment of Sedleigh_ and on his first day there he meets Psmith_ likewise a new boy_ superannuated from Eton. From this point onwards Psmith dominates the scene. . ."""
The World of Psmith,Fiction_General_Humor,This omnibus edition collects Mike and Psmith (in hardcover) Psmith in the City_ Psmith Journalist_ and Leave it to Psmith_ practically all the Psmith material extant_ save for variations or possible random appearances in other works. As far as we have been able to determine_ Mike and Psmith is not included in the paperback editions of this book.
Something New,Fiction_General_Humor,The one thing that could be expected to militate against the peace of life at Blandings is the constant incursion of impostors. Blandings has impostors like other houses have mice. On this particular occasion there are two of them?at least one of them intent on purloining a rare scarab. Lord Emsworth's secretary_ the Efficient Baxter_ is on the alert and determined to discover what is afoot_ despite the distractions caused by the Hon. Freddie Threepwood's latest hapless affair of the heart.An earlier_ somewhat different version of the novel was published in New York a month earlier as Something New. This version_ or at least a version with the same title_ was re-issued in 2000 by Dover Books.
Summer Lightning,Fiction_General_Humor,Hugo Carmody loves Millicent_ Lord Emsworth's niece_ but is rather good friends with Sue Brown of the Regal Theater_ which rather annoys Millicent.

A good deal of confusion ensues_ and Lord Emsworth's prize pig gets stolen_ as usual.
Heavy Weather,Fiction_General_Humor,The story of the Honourable Galahad Threepwood_ who proposes to publish a memoir filled with the youthful indiscretions of his friends_ now bishops and dowagers and cabinet ministers. His prospective victims respond with various threats_ but Galahad will withhold the book only if nephew Ronnie is permitted to marry the chorus girl of his choice?an arrangement Ronnie?s mother won?t tolerate.

The Dragons of the Cuyahoga,Fiction_Fantasy_Contemporary_Alternate and Parallel Worlds,"It all started about a decade ago_ when the Portal suddenly opened up over the stadium right in the middle of a game. Cleveland just hadn't been the same since_ what with electronic devices pretty much useless -- unless you were willing to spend a fortune in digital prduction and redundancy equipment -- and all the dragons_ elves_ gnomes_ dwarves_  gargoyles_ etc. who'd come through the portal to take up residence within the areas covered by the Portal's magical field.

For Kline Maxwell_ City Hall reporter for the Cleveland Press_ magic-based Cleveland had long since become the status quo. At least until a fellow reporter named Morgan came down with a case of eyeballs growing all over his body. The diagnosis: stay out of Portal territory and he'd be just fine. But that meant Maxwell and all the other reporters were going to have to take up the slack. And Maxwell hated the thought of doing ""fuzzy gnome"" stories. Still_ he took his job seriously_ and when he was assigned to cover a dragon's death by crash-landing into the Cuyahoga_ he headed over to the accident site with only a modest number of curses. But what should have been a simple accident report soon led Maxwell in search of a much bigger story -- one that would see him kidnapped by elves_ framed for murder_ holding secret meetings with dragons_ and fleeing not only from the cops but from pretty much everyone..."
Something New,Fiction_General_Humor,Something New was the original New York version of the novel published a month later in England as Something Fresh. In this U.S. version Ashe Marson and George Emerson are American_ and it includes an episode about Baxter and the paint on a shoe that had already been told in Mike. Since this version has been recently reprinted_ we feel it warrants its own page_ if only for the nifty scarab cover.

A Pelican at Blandings,Fiction_General_Humor,"Feeling like the fellow in the melodrama who (or is it whom?) the villain has just foreclosed on_ Lord Emsworth lay back in a chair in his study_ enjoying that all-encompassing sense of relief the departure of his sister always afforded him_ his brain working at top speed as it calculated his chances of surviving the fruity crisis she had just dropped in his lap. He needed Galahad for this one_ that much was clear.  Many years' membership in the old Pelican Club had given the Hon. Galahad Threepwood the enviable abliity to keep cool_ stiffen his upper lip and always think a shade quicker than the next man.

Death by Espionage,Fiction_Adventure_Spy/Espionage_Crime_Mistery_Suspense,"So few spies reach retirement age. Perhaps that's because the first rule of the game is that everybody dies- well_ almost everybody. The quest for information makes for complex and particularly interesting characters_ and at least a few of them survive to enjoy the ill-gotten fruit of their labors. Or is it ill-gotten?

The stories in DEATH BY ESPIONAGE come from the imaginations of members of the International Association of Crime Writers and some of the world's best-known authors. Their agents stealthily slip in and out of this collection of twenty stories with settings ranging from a Civil War outpost and Victorian England to Hitler's Fortress Europa and the post-Cold War world. The stories delve into themes of betrayal_ revenge_ and treachery and demonstrate the mind games and manipulations for which spies are so renowned.

These stories brim with missions behind enemy lines_ red herrings_ Swiss bank accounts_ ingenious entrapments_ and coded instructions. There are German spies in America and Allied spies in Europe during World War II. There are Israeli spies and spies in Latin America. There are assassins and seducers_ stolen plans and intricate games of cat and mouse. And there are grudges. The universal rule_ however_ is that no one gets to write their memoirs.

Mem�rias p�stumas de Br�s Cubas,Fiction_General,"""Be aware that frankness is the prime virtue of a dead man_"" writes the narrator of The Posthumous Memoirs of Bras Cubas. But while he may be dead_ he is surely one of the liveliest characters in fiction_ a product of one of the most remarkable imaginations in all of literature_ Brazil's greatest novelist of the nineteenth century_ Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis.

By turns flippant and profound_ The Posthumous Memoirs of Br�s Cubas is the story of an unheroic man with half-hearted political ambitions_ a harebrained idea for curing the world of melancholy_ and a thousand quixotic theories unleashed from beyond the grave."
Quincas Borba,Fiction_General,When the mad philosopher Quincas Borba dies_ he leaves to his friend Rubiao the entirety of his wealth and property_ with a single stipulation: Rubiao must take care of Quincas Borba's dog_ who is also named Quincas Borba_ and who may indeed have assumed the soul of the dead philosopher. Flush with his newfound wealth_ Rubiao heads for Rio de Janeiro and plunges headlong into a world where fantasy and reality become increasingly difficult to keep separate.
Esa� e Jac�,Fiction_General,"From the time they were in their mother's womb_ the Santos twins Pedro and Paulo were fierce rivals. They fought for the right to enter the world first_ then competed to see who could suckle at the breast with greater hunger and determination. Soon politics entered their lives and stoked the fire of their antagonism. But it was not until they met Flora_ the beautiful but ""inexplicable"" daughter of a neighboring couple_ that their lifelong rivalry found its greatest contest - and encountered its most profound suffering.

Here_ the story of twin brothers in love with the same woman intertwines with the story of Brazil itself_ caught between the traditional and the modern and between the monarchical and republican ideals. But in contrast to the heroic biblical pair of the title_ Machado de Assis's twins have trouble escaping the petty squabbles_ conflicting ambitions_ doubts and insecurities that define the human condition and plague society."
Dom Casmurro,Fiction_General,Like other great nineteenth century novels_ Machado de Assis's Dom Casmurro explores the themes of marriage and adultery. But what distinguishes Machado's novel and what makes it such a delightful discovery for English-speaking readers_ is its eccentric and wildly unpredictable narrative style. As he recounts the events of his life from the vantage of a lonely old age_ the narrator Bento continually interrupts his story to reflect on the writing of it. But the novel is more than a performance of stylistic acrobatics. It is an ironic critique of Catholicism_ in which God appears as a kind of divine accountant whose ledgers may be balanced in devious as well as pious ways. It is also a story about love and its obstacles_ about deception and self-deception_ and about the failure of memory to make life's beginning fit neatly into its end.
El jard�n de al lado,Fiction_General,A Chilean writer named Julio and his wife_ Gloria_ are beset by worries_ constantly bickering about money_ their writing_ and their son (who may or may not be plying the oldest trade in Marrakesh). When Julio's boyhood best friend lends the couple his luxurious Madrid apartment for the summer_ it is an escape for both - in particular for Julio_ who fantasizes about the garden next door and the erotic life of the lovely young aristocratic woman who inhabits it.

With irascible determination - and a great deal of outright chaos - the party experiences both the awesome majesty and brutal savagery of the unexplored land_ from buffalo stampedes and natural disasters to Indian raids and encounters with frontiersmen and trappers_ explorers_ pioneers_ and one part-time preacher known as ""the Sin Killer"". Packed with breathtaking adventure_ charming romance_ and a sense of humor stretching clear over the horizon_ SIN KILLER is a truly unique vision of the West."
The Wandering Hill,Fiction_Western_Land Rush_Singular Woman_Sagas,"In The Wandering Hill_ Larry McMurty continues the story of Tasmin Berrybender and her family in the still unexplored Wild West of the 1830s_ at the point in time when the Mountain Men and trappers like Jim Bridger and Kit Carson (both lively characters in the book)_ though still alive_ are already legendary figures_ when the journey of Lewis and Clark is still a living memory_ while the painter George Catlin is at work capturing the Mandan tribes just before they are eliminated by the incursion of the white man and smallpox_ and when the clash between the powerful Indian tribes of the Missouri and the encroaching white Americans is about to turn into full-blown tragedy.
Amidst all this_ the Berrybender family - English_ eccentric_ wealthy_ and fiercely out of place - continues its journey of exploration_ although beset by difficulties_ tragedies_ the desertion of trusted servants_ and the increasing hardships of day-to-day survival in a land where nothing can be taken for granted.
Abandoning their luxurious steamer_ which is stuck in the ice near the Knife River_ they make their way overland to the confluence of the Missouri and the Yellowstone_ to spend the winter in conditions of seige at the trading post of Pierre Boisdeffre_ right smack in what is_ from their point of view_ the middle of nowhere. By now_ Tasmin is a married woman_ or as good as_ and about to be a mother_ living with the elusive young mountain man Jim Snow (The Sin Killer)_ and not only going to have his child_ but to discover that he has a whole other Indian family he hasn't told her about.
On his part_ Jim is about to discover that in taking the outspoken_ tough-minded_ stubbornly practical young aristocratic woman into his teepee he has bitten off more than he can chew - Tasmin doesn't hesitate to answer back_ use the name of the Lord in vain_ and strike out_ though she is taken aback when the quiet Jim actually strikes her.
Still_ theirs is a great love affair_ lived out in conditions of great risk_ and dominates this volume of Larry McMurty's Berrybender Narratives_ in which Tasmin gradually takes center stage as her father loses his strength and powers of concentration_ and her family goes to pieces stranded in the hostile wilderness_ surrounded by interesting savages with ideas of their own and mountain men who are all of the ""strong_ silent type"" of later Western legend_ and hardly less savage than the Indians.
From the murder of the iced-in steamship's crew to the appearance of the Partezon_ a particularly bloodthirsty Sioux warrior with a band of over two hundred followers (the Partezon thoughtfully buries one of Lord Berrybender's servants alive in a gutted buffalo_ ordering his feet and hands to be chopped off so he will fit into the body cavity_ to see if the man can get out)_ The Wandering Hill (which refers to a powerful and threatening legend in local Indian folklore) is at once literature on a grand scale and riveting entertainment by a master storyteller."
Space Wolf,Fiction_Science_Adventure_Militaristic,"Ragnar leapt up from his hiding place_ bolt pistol spitting death. The nightgangers could not help but notice where he was_ and with a mighty roar of frenzied rage they raced towards him [sic]. Ragnar answered their war cry with a wolfish howl of his own_ and was reassured to hear it echoed back from the throats of the surrounding Blood Claws. He pulled the trigger again and again as the frenzied mass of mutants approached_ sending bolter shell after bolter shell rocketing into his targets. Ragnar laughed aloud_ feeling the full battle rage come upon him. The beast roared within his soul_ demanding to be unleashed.

In the grim future of Warhammer 40_000_ the Space Marines of the Adeptus Astartes are humanity?s last hope. On the planet Fenris_ young Ragnar is chosen to be inducted into the noble yet savage Space Wolves chapter. But with his ancient primal instincts unleashed by the implanting of the sacred Canis Helix_ Ragnar must learn to control the beast within and fight for the greater good of the wolf pack."
By Sorrow's River,Fiction_Western_Land Rush_Singular Woman_Sagas,"In this tale of adventure_ at once high-spirited and terrifying_ set against the background of the West that Larry McMurty has made his own_ By Sorrow's River is an epic in its own right with an extraordinary young woman at its heart.
At the heart of this third volume of his Western saga remains the beautiful and determined Tasmin Berrybender_ now married to the ""Sin Killer"" and mother to their young son_ Monty_ who_ although Tasmin intends him to be an English gentleman like his grandfather_ is at the moment living the childhood of a savage.
By Sorrow's River continues the Berrybender party's trail across the endless Great Plains of the West toward Santa Fe_ where they intend_ those who are lucky enough to survive the journey_ to spend the winter. Along the way_ Tasmin_ whose husband_ Jim Snow_ has vanished off to scout ahead of them_ falls in love with Pomp Charbonneau_ only to see him killed by the ruthless commander of Spanish troops_ while her father_ Lord Berrybender_ now reduced to limping along on one leg and a pair of crutches_ increasingly makes a fool of himself by falling in love with his own mistress. They meet up with a vast cast of characters from the history of the West: Kit Carson_ the famous scout; Le Partezon_ the fearsome Sioux war chief; The Ear Taker_ an Indian whose speciality is creeping up on people while they are asleep and slicing off an ear with a sharp knife; two aristocratic Frenchmen whose eccentric aim is to cross the Great Plains by hot air balloon; a party of slavers led by the cowardly but bloodthirsty Obregon; a band of raiding Pawnee; and many other astonishing characters who prove_ once again_ that the rolling_ grassy plains are not_ in fact_ nearly as empty of life as they look. Most of what is there is dangerous and hostile_ even when faced with Tasmin's remarkable_ frosty sangfroid. She is one of the strongest and most interesting of Larry McMurty's women characters_ fairly resistant to shock_ whether at bloodshed_ the behavior of children_ or sex_ and at the center of this powerful and ambitious novel of the West."

????????,Fiction_Nonfiction,"What does it mean to be good? What enables us to distinguish right from wrong? And how should human virtues be translated into a just society? These are the questions that Plato sought to answer in this monumental work of moral and political philosophy_ a book surpassed only by the Bible in its formative influence on two thousand years of Western thought.

In the course of its tautly reasoned Socratic dialogues_ The Republic accomplishes nothing less than an anatomy of the soul and an exhaustive description of a State that both mirrors and enforces the soul's ideal harmony. The resulting text is at once mystical and elegantly logical and may be read as a template for the societies in which most of us live today."

Queremos tanto a Glenda y otros relatos,Fiction_General_Literary Fiction/classics,"Entering?in these ten stories?the mysterious_ passionate_ and apocalyptic world of Julio Cort�zar_ we are made suddenly and sometimes terrifyingly aware of the unexploded mines beneath the surface of our conscious lives. In the title story a group of fans of the legendary movie star Glenda Carson meet at showings of her films and eventually become an informal cadre of the fanatically devoted. ('There was nothing of a club about it_ we simply loved Glenda Carson_ and that was enough to set us apart from those who only admired her.') Gradually_ hesitantly at first_ they dare to acknowledge to one another that they find some of the scenes in some of her films somewhat less than perfect. So they devise an audacious plan to get hold of and re-edit every print of every film she ever made. 'We had problems with The Uses of Elegance because people in the oil-producing emirates owned copies for their personal enjoyment and extraordinary maneuvers and procedures were necessary in order to steal them (there's no reason to use any other word).... ' But finally it's done_ and nothing can mar the Carson oeuvre... until she announces unexpectedly that she is going to come out of retirement and make another film. Then_ together the group decides what they must do. 'We loved Glenda so much that we would offer her one last inviolable perfection. On the untouchable heights to which we had raised her in exaltation_ we would save her from the fall...' In 'Clone' a modern madrigal group-subtle_ sophisticated_ gifted men and women-touring Latin America performing the works of the Renaissance composer Cesualdo find themselves re-enacting scenes from his life: his wife's infidelities and his own abrupt and tragic response....And in story after story a violent and unsettling suspense prevails as intense emotional conflict erupts from cerebral_ intellectual play. Locales range from the Buenos Aires subway to a luxurious resort hotel on Martinique; the characters from an English college girl on a bicycling tour of the Dordogne to a black cat named Osiris_ whom the narrator suspects of alienating his wife's affection; and the ostensible subjects from the varieties of political oppression in Argentina to the suspicions of a young mother that the man paying court to her maid is really her own betrayed lover seeking revenge. But whatever the text of a story_ the subtext always bears the disturbing signature of the writer who has been called 'a spy in the dense and elusive world of words.'

"The Man of Jasmine, and Other Texts",Fiction_Nonfiction,"In 1970_ Unica Z�rn_ the companion and lover of the Surrealist artist Hans Bellmer_ threw herself from the sixth floor window of their apartment in Paris. Her suicide was the culmination of thirteen years of mental crises which are described with disarming lucidity in The Man Of Jasmine_ subtitled Impressions from a Mental Illness. 
Z�rn?s mental collapse was initiated when she encountered in the real world her childhood fantasy figure ""the man of jasmine"": he was the writer Henri Michaux_ and her meeting him plunged her into a world of hallucination in which visions of her desires_ anxieties and events from her unresolved past overwhelmed her present life. Her return to ""reality"" was constantly interrupted by alternate visionary and depressive periods. Z�rn?s compelling narrative also reveals her uneasy relationship with words and language_ which she attempted to resolve by the compulsive writing of anagrams. Anagrams allowed her to dissect the language of everyday_ to personalise it_ and to make it reveal hidden at its core astonishing messages_ threats and evocations. They formed the basis of her interpretation of the split between her inner & outer lives and underpin the texts included in this selection. 

The Man of Jasmine is certainly one of the greatest descriptions of mental collapse_ but it is much more. Z�rn?s familiarity with Surrealist conceptions of the psyche_ and her extraordinary self-possession during the most alarming experiences are allied to vivid descriptive powers which make this a literary as well as a psychological masterpiece."

So Long Been Dreaming: Postcolonial Science Fiction & Fantasy,Fiction_Science,"So Long Been Dreaming: Postcolonial Science Fiction & Fantasy is an anthology of original new stories by leading African_ Asian_ South Asian and Aboriginal authors_ as well as North American and British writers of color.

Stories of imagined futures abound in Western writing. Writer and editor Nalo Hopkinson notes that the science fiction/fantasy genre ""speaks so much about the experience of being alienated but contains so little writing by alienated people themselves."" It's an oversight that Hopkinson and Mehan aim to correct with this anthology.

The book depicts imagined futures from the perspectives of writers associated with what might loosely be termed the ""third world."" It includes stories that are bold_ imaginative_ edgy; stories that are centered in the worlds of the ""developing"" nations; stories that dare to dream what we might develop into.

The wealth of postcolonial literature has included many who have written insightfully about their pasts and presents. With So Long Been Dreaming they creatively address their futures.

In The Norton Book of the Sea_ Volume II_ Fiction_ Coote celebrates the sea as both a friend and a foe that has captivated fiction writers seeking to explore and understand its unassailable force. Volume II_ like its predecessor_ is organized by category_ including The Sea_ Captains and Crews_ The Dark Side_ The Lighter Side_ Ships in Peacetime_ Ships at War_ Navigation_ and Sweethearts and Wives. To gather his selections_ Coote has cast his net wide over fiction writers from Shakespeare_ Ernest Hemingway_ C.S. Forester_ Herman Melville_ and Joseph Conrad_ to Tobias Smollett_ Evelyn Waugh_ Alistair MacLean_ and William Golding. Some of the names are familiar; others_ like Evelyn Waugh_ though familiar as popular fiction writers_ are less well known as writers of literature about the sea.

Throughout the anthology_ Coote interweaves his own pithy and insightful anecdotes and facts about the various authors and excerpts he's selected. The result is a remarkably rich and varied body of work that_ from the first page_ draws the reader into the realm of the sea_ there to join Johnnie Coote in his thoroughly engaging ""literary trawling.""

Bolingbroke was exiled by the King but returned to England when Richard confiscated John of Gaunt's estates. ﾠBolingbroke came to claim them -- and at the same time the crown.

Richard was deposed and died mysteriously_ murdered it was said on the order of Bolingbroke_ now King Henry the Fourth. But Henry found the crown harder to hold than to win. He was beset by enemies -- the Welsh_ the Scots and the mighty Hotspur; the country was rumbling with revolt against the King whom many called the Impostor.

Dominating the court was Harry of Monmouth_ his fingers itching to take the crown_ his reckless conduct causing scandal since he frequented disreputable company in the low-class taverns of East Cheap with his crony Sir John Oldcastle.

There came a time when the disease which had caused the King to hide away claimed him and Harry became King Henry the Fifth. The change was miraculous_ both for him and Oldcastle.

Edward's most trusted supporter was his brother Richard_ Duke of Gloucester_ and his worst enemy his brother George_ Duke of Clarence. George's perfidy brought him to a violent end in the Tower of London but Richard lived on to become the Lord Protector and briefly to wear the crown.

At the center of events was Edward_ splendid in appearance and beloved of the people. His favorite device was that of the sun in all its splendour surrounding the white roses of York. Two women he loved above all the others played their part in history -- his cool calculating Queen and Jane Shore_ the warm hearted goldsmith's wife.

The Captive of Kensington Palace,"Fiction_Historical_The ""royals""_British Isles","Young Princess Victoria was never allowed to be alone. She was always protected from political intrigue and royal scandal -- a virtual prisoner of her ambitious mother and her scheming lover. It didn't take long for Victoria to become aware of the sinister conflicts surrounding her. There were those who were obsessed with usurping her future by either violence or marriage. And there were those who were determined she would never take the throne.

But no one could deny the glorious destiny that awaited her..."
The Queen and Lord M,"Fiction_Historical_The ""royals""_British Isles","Early on the morning of the 20th June in the year 1837_ the Archbishop of Canterbury and Lord Chamberlain came to the palace of Kensington to tell an eighteen-year-old girl that she was Queen of England. The Victorian age had begun. Young_ determined to dedicate herself to her country_ deeply and demonstratively affectionate by nature_ the Queen immediately succumbed to the worldly charm of Lord Melbourne_ her Prime Minister.

This is a novel of the first years of the Queen's reign before her marriage to the Prince Consort. The innocent young girl found that she was at the heart of Palace feuds_ intrigues and scandals which were to oust her from public favor_ and the charming Queen whose youth and innocence had so appealed to the people became the villainess of the Flora Hastings scandal_ the despot of the Bedchamber Plot and the subject of speculation concerning her relationship with her Prime Minister.

There was conflict between the Queen and her mother_ the flamboyant Duchess of Kent_ whose name was linked with that of Sir John Conroy_ whom Victoria detested; and of another kind with Sir Robert Peel who became victim of the Queen's spite; and there was the aging Duke of Wellington who incurred her anger.

The scene is dominated by the imperious_ hot-tempered Queen_ unswervingly loyal to those whom she loves_ as her dear 'Lord M'. And there is Melbourne himself_ the aging politician and worldly cynic_ the Prime Minister with the stormy past. The publicly-conducted intrigue between his mad wife_ Lady Caroline Lamb_ and the scandalous Lord Byron_ though over long before the Queen's Accession_ reverberated through the years; yet in spite of being cited as co-respondant in two divorce cases_ he retained his position as Prime Minister and became a partner in a romantic relationship with the young Victoria."
The Queen's Husband,"Fiction_Historical_The ""royals""_British Isles","From the time they were in their cradles Victoria and Albert were destined for each other; but when Victoria came to the throne and became devoted to her Prime Minister_ Lord Melbourne_ she had no wish for marriage -- until she saw Albert.

Albert_ as the younger son of a minor German Duke_ was necessarily ambitious and aware of what marriage with the Queen of England could mean; and when Victoria immediately fell in love with him_ he believed his future was secure. But he did not know the Queen's nature and that beneath that clinging femininity was a will of iron. Wholeheartedly affectionate_ impulsive_ demonstrative_ loyal and possessed of a notoriously hot temper_ loving to gossip and dance till the early hours of morning_ Victoria's character was in complete opposition to that of her serious husband who liked to rise at dawn and retire early.

It was inevitable that during the first years the relationship was stormy. The Queen was in perpetual revolt against any encroachment on her position_ as well as the constant pregnancies she had to endure. Albert's battle was for supremacy and he was determined that Victoria should regard herself as his wife first_ as Queen second.

These were significant years when British history was shaped by statesmen such as Sir Robert Peel and Lord Palmerston and by great events such as the Crimean War and the Indian Mutiny; more than once the Queen came near to death through assassination.

Yet her life was dominated by her husband and family. There was naughty Bertie_ brilliant Vicky_ placid Alice_ delicate Leopold and five other children of the marriage. But for the Queen there was one who meant more than the rest of the world put together -- Albert.

So the Victorian age was created and the power behind the throne was the Queen's Husband."
The Widow of Windsor,"Fiction_Historical_The ""royals""_British Isles","Albert was dead and the Queen_ stricken with grief_ prepared to spend the rest of her life mourning. Her Government and her family sought to bring her out of seclusion but she was determined to remain the Widow of Windsor.

The years which followed were some of the most momentous in British history_ some of the Queen's ministers the most famous. There was the great Palmerston who managed to keep a mocking ascendancy over her; Mr. Gladstone_ Grand Old Man and People's William_ who prowled the streets at night in an attempt to lead prostitutes back to a life of respectability_ and who was no favorite of the Queen_ unlike the witty Disraeli_ who charmed her completely.

She was surrounded by the colorful members of her family -- sons_ daughters_ their wives and husbands_ her grandchildren. There was the censorious Vicky_ Crown Princess of Prussia and Empress-to-be who suffered great domestic tragedy; Louise who married outside royalty; Lenchen and baby Beatrice; there was Alfred whose amorous adventures caused his mother such concern and Leopold whose ill health was an even greater anxiety; there was Arthur who had inherited his father's goodness; and above all there was Bertie_ Prince of Wales and heir to the throne. Suppressed in his father's lifetime_ he was determined to pursue pleasure for the rest of his life and his passions were racing and fascinating women. His adventures twice brought him into the witness box to give evidence in famous trials which created the scandals of the decade_ and brought sorrow and humiliation to Alexandra_ whose happy childhood in the Yellow Palace of Denmark had ill prepared her for life with the gay and charming philanderer whom she discovered her husband to be.

But Queen Victoria at Windsor_ Balmoral_ Osborne or Buckingham Palace cannot fail to dominate the scene. Her relationship with John Brown_ the rough Highlander_ gave rise to speculation_ but she was impervious to scandal. All the fascinating characters of an unforgettable age rotate about her like planets round the sun; she remained the great Queen until the moment of her death and the passing of an era."

minds. Newly arrived Second Lieutenant Waino Mellas_ so green his boots aren?t even scuffed_ 
is flown in to command one of the company?s three platoons. Though he was at the top of his 
class at Basic School_ Mellas's Ivy League education hasn?t quite prepared him to lead forty 
battle-hardened Marines. He will need the help of his fellow officers: Fitch_ the harried company 
commander who_ at twenty-three_ is already straining under the weight of his responsibilities; 
Hawke_ the charismatic executive officer who is suspicious of Mellas?s ambition; and Mellas?s 
fellow platoon leaders_ Goodwin and Kendall_ who have troubles of their own. 
 
 
Soon the company is ordered to abandon Matterhorn and embark on a dangerous mission to 
sever a crucial North Vietnamese supply line. As the Marines navigate the bewildering valleys 
and switchbacks of the jungle they endure a series of deadly tests?firefights_ mortar attacks_ 
snipers?and are driven forward by a capricious colonel who_ thanks to new technology_ is trying 
to fight the war by long-range radio. Besides the political tension between officers_ it?s the 
height of the Civil Rights and black power movements_ and the company?s black soldiers resent 
their treatment. Mellas feels torn between wanting the support of the black soldiers and needing 
to quell their increasing hostility. But when the Marines find themselves confronted by a 
massive enemy regiment_ they are thrust into the raw and all-consuming terror of combat. As 
each man fights for his life and the lives of his friends_ Mellas must face the reality of the war_ 
the truth of his motives_ and the depth of his commitments. The experience will change him 
forever."

Lyrische Novelle,Fiction_General_Youth,"Annemarie Schwarzenbach?journalist_ novelist_ antifascist_ archaeologist and traveller? has become a European cult figure for bohemian free spirits since the rediscovery of her works in the late 1980s. Lyric Novella is her story of a young man?s obsession for a Berlin vari�t� actress.

His family_ future and social standing become irrelevant when set against his overriding compulsion to pick her up every night from the theatre so they can go for a drive.

Schwarzenbach?s clear_ psychologically acute prose makes this novella an evocative narrative_ with many intriguing parallels to her own life. In fact_ she admitted after publication that her hero was a young woman_ not a man_ leaving little doubt that Lyric Novella is a literary tale of lesbian love during socially and politically turbulent times."
Der Geliebte der Mutter,Fiction_General_Ties That Bind,"It?s Switzerland in the 1920s when the two lovers first meet. She is young_ beautiful and rich. In contrast_ he can barely support himself and is interested only in music. By the end of their lives_ he is a famous conductor and the richest man in the country_ but she is penniless. And most important of all_ no one knows of her love for him; it is a secret he took to his grave. Here begins Urs Widmer?s novel My Mother?s Lover.

Based on a real-life affair_ My Mother?s Lover?the first part of a much-loved trilogy?is the story of a lifelong and unspoken love for a man?recorded by the woman?s son_ who begins this novel on the day his mother?s lover dies. Set against the backdrop of the Depression and World War II_ it is a story of sacrifice and betrayal_ passionate devotion and inevitable suffering. Yet in Widmer?s hands_ it is always entertaining and surprisingly comic?a unique kind of fairy tale."
Noah,Mythology_Reinterpretations_Fiction_General_Humor_Satire,As the current global recession stubbornly persists and financial experts around the world struggle to prevent further financial collapse_ everyone has a theory about how to save the economy. But perhaps no idea that has been proffered is as radical or as unique as what Hugo Loetscher imagines in his novel Noah. In this book_ first published in German in 1967_ the eponymous Old Testament hero fuels his local economy with a prescient plan to build the Ark. Though no one around him seriously believes in the coming flood_ everyone is more than willing to do business with him: ?The people of Mesopotamia had never had it so good. There had been an economic miracle.? It is boom time in Mesopotamia_ and the economy is flourishing
Das Buch des Vaters,Fiction_General_Ties That Bind,"In this companion to Urs Widmer?s novel My Mother?s Lover_ the narrator is again the son who pieces together the fragments of his parents? stories. Since the age of 12_ Karl_ the father_ has observed the family tradition of recording his life in a single notebook_ but when his book is lost soon after his death_ his son resolves to rewrite it.

We learn of the early years of Karl?s marriage and follow his military service as the Swiss fear a German invasion during the Second World War_ his political activity for the Communist Party and his brief career as a teacher. We are told of Karl?s literary translations of his favourite French books_ and_ most important_ the eerie and ever-present coffins outside the houses in the home village of Karl?s father_ one reserved for each individual from the day he or she is born.

Widmer brilliantly combines family history and historical events to tell the story of a man more at home in the world of the imagination than in the real world_ a father who grows on the reader just as he grows on his son."
Dunkle Gesellschaft. Roman in zehn Regenn�chten,Fiction_Fantasy_Literary Fantasy,"?Of course I had to end up here . . .?
 
Over ten rainy nights_ Thomas_ an ex-bargeman who used to be skipper of his own boat_ walks the muddy fields of the landlocked German interior and remembers the events that lost him his home_ his boat_ and his livelihood: his apprenticeship in the cold halls of the Royal Naval College in London; the dangers of the mean streets and waterfront of New York in the 1970s_ and Poland under martial law; Germany after the reunification_ when for a year or so it seemed that the whole country drifted rudderless_ drawn by the current of history to who knows where. In this novel from Gert Losch�tz_Thomas remembers childhood_ his first love_ and the warnings of his grandfather: Beware the dark company! This mysterious band of men and women dressed in black cast a shadow over his story_ as he wrestles with the secrets_ the unplumbed depths of his soul_ the hazards lurking below a seemingly placid surface_ and throughout it all_ the rain_ falling night after night.

Dark Company is a superb example of a distinctly German tradition in weird fiction which claims its roots in Kafka and Herbert Rosendorfer."
Three Plays,Drama and Plays_German,"Despite being widely acknowledged as one of the most important German dramatists since Bertolt Brecht_ Heiner M�ller (1929?95) still remains relatively unknown in the English-speaking world. This collection of plays aims to change that_ presenting new translations and opening up his work to a larger audience. Collected here are three of his plays?Philoctetes_ The Horatian and Mauser?that together constitute what M�ller called an ?experimental series?_ which both develops and critiques Brecht?s theory of the Lehrst�ck_ or ?learning play?.

Based on a tragedy by Sophocles_ Philoctetes dramatizes the confrontation between politics_ morality and the desire for revenge.
The Horatian uses an incident from ancient Rome as an example of ways of approaching the moral ambiguity of the past.

Finally_ Mauser_ set during the Russian civil war_ examines the nature and ethics of revolutionary violence.

The plays are accompanied by supporting materials written by M�ller himself_ as well as an introduction by Uwe Sch�tte that contextualizes the plays and speaks of their continued relevance today."
Die Schattenboxerin,Fiction_General_Regional Interest,In The Shadow-Boxing Woman_ a novel from German writer Inka Parei_ a decaying apartment building in post-Wall Berlin is home to Hell_ a young woman with a passion for martial arts. When Hell?s neighbour disappears she sets out across the city in search of her. In the course of her quest_ she falls in love with a bank robber_ confronts her own dark memories_ and ends up saving more than just her missing neighbour. What is on the surface a crime novel is actually a haunting dual portrait of a city and a woman caught up in times of change and transition. This debut novel combines Parei?s tight prose with a compulsive delight in detail that dynamically evokes many lost and overlooked corners of Berlin.
Biographie. Ein Spiel,Drama and Plays_Experimental & Absurd,"In this play by Swiss playwright and novelist Max Frisch_ a middle-aged behavioral researcher K�rmann is given the opportunity to start his life over at any point he chooses and change his decisions and actions in matters both serious and mundane?He could save his marriage_ become politically active_ take better care of his health_ or even change the color of his living-room furniture. Despite his intention to apply the wisdom he has acquired with age_ K�rmann finds himself inexorably trapped in the same decisions. Ultimately proving fatal_ K�rmann?s life game interrogates how much of our own path is shaped by seemingly random factors and how much is in fact predetermined by our own limited_ conditioned selves. The play?s central idea?that our lives are nothing but a self-conscious play with imaginary identities?is brilliantly captured in Biography?s dramaturgical form_ set up a theatre rehearsal as the metaphor for the endless possibilities and variables of the game of life.

Frisch?s own revised_ dramatically heightened version of his play celebrates not only the theatre as a form of self-expression but also the human condition in all its potential and limitations as it showcases both comic and tragic outcomes that define all our lives."
Feuer brennt nicht,Fiction_General_Regional Interest,Almost twenty years after the fall of the wall_ the Kreuzberg district of Berlin has become unbearably trendy and deeply unappealing to Alina and Wolf.

But there_ Wolf finds himself increasingly strained by the triviality of his daily routine with Alina. The monotony of life in their comfortable apartment gives way_ however_ when an old girlfriend surfaces and Wolf escapes his boredom into a torrid affair. As Wolf�s struggle with his infidelity grows_ so grows the hell of his concealment.
Gr�nschnabel,Fiction_General_Ties That Bind,"?My father bought me from the council for 365 francs_? recalls the narrator in Monica Cantieni?s novel_ The Encyclopaedia of Good Reasons. She?s a young girl_ an immigrant to Switzerland whose adoption is yet to be finalized. When she finally moves into her new home with her new family_ she recounts her days in the orphanage and how starkly different her life is now. Her new community speaks German_ a language foreign to her_ and she collects words and phrases in matchboxes.

Set in the time of the crucial 1970 Swiss referendum on immigration_ Monica Cantieni introduces us to a host of colorful characters who struggle to make Switzerland their home: Eli_ the Spanish bricklayer; Toni_ the Italian factory worker with movie star looks; Madame Jelisaweta_ the Yugoslav hairdresser; and Milena_ the mysterious girl in the wardrobe."

Animals hide in shells_ trees pull in branches_ and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter.

Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were fought for them_ and won by them.

In a war that makes no sense_ where ten armies fight separately against a single foe_ he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable.

Across the ocean_ an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under an eminent scholar and notorious heretic_ Dalinar?s niece_ Jasnah.

Life before death.
Strength before weakness.
Journey before Destination.

Six years ago_ the Assassin in White_ a hireling of the inscrutable Parshendi_ assassinated the Alethi king on the very night a treaty between men and Parshendi was being celebrated. So began the Vengeance Pact among the highprinces of Alethkar and the War of Reckoning against the Parshendi. 

Now the Assassin is active again_ murdering rulers all over the world of Roshar_ using his baffling powers to thwart every bodyguard and elude all pursuers. Among his prime targets is Highprince Dalinar_ widely considered the power behind the Alethi throne. His leading role in the war would seem reason enough_ but the Assassin?s master has much deeper motives.

Expected by his enemies to die the miserable death of a military slave_ Kaladin survived to be given command of the royal bodyguards_ a controversial first for a low-status ""darkeyes."" Now he must protect the king and Dalinar from every common peril as well as the distinctly uncommon threat of the Assassin_ all while secretly struggling to master remarkable new powers that are somehow linked to his honorspren_ Syl.

Brilliant but troubled Shallan strives along a parallel path. Despite being broken in ways she refuses to acknowledge_ she bears a terrible burden: to somehow prevent the return of the legendary Voidbringers and the civilization-ending Desolation that will follow. The secrets she needs can be found at the Shattered Plains_ but just arriving there proves more difficult than she could have imagined.

Meanwhile_ at the heart of the Shattered Plains_ the Parshendi are making an epochal decision. Hard pressed by years of Alethi attacks_ their numbers ever shrinking_ they are convinced by their war leader_ Eshonai_ to risk everything on a desperate gamble with the very supernatural forces they once fled. The possible consequences for Parshendi and humans alike_ indeed_ for Roshar itself_ are as dangerous as they are incalculable.

The doors of the Stormlight Archive first opened to us with The Way of Kings. Read that book ? now available in all formats ? and then Words of Radiance_ and you can be part of the adventure every dazzling step of the way."

Gods and Generals: A Novel of the Civil War,Fiction_Historical_American Civil War,"Here is Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson_ a hopelessly by-the-book military instructor and devout Christian.

We follow Winfield Scott Hancock_ a Captain of Quartermasters who is assigned command of a brigade of infantry_ quickly establishing himself as one of the finest leaders in the Union army. Then there is Joshua Chamberlain_ who gives up his promising academic career to volunteer for service in the new army_ only to become one of the most heroic soldiers in American history. And here too is a brilliant portrait of the complex_ aristocratic Robert E. Lee_ who is faced with the agonizing decision of resigning from a distinguished thirty-year army career in order to defend his home_ never believing until too late that a civil war would ever truly come to pass. As the war gathers momentum_ Stonewall Jackson wins his reputation by a series of stinging victories over ineptly led Union forces. Lee_ finally given command of the Confederate forces_ recognizes that this strange_ devout_ and dangerous man is his greatest weapon. For a time_ it truly seems as if God is on their side and that Lee will lead his army to final victory against overwhelming odds. Nowhere is this plainer than at the Battle of Fredericksburg_ where_ for the first time_ all four men meet on the same field and experience the exhilaration and raw horror of battle from four very different points of view. But it is in the next great fight_ the Battle of Chancellorsville_ that Lee's brilliant strategy_ and Jackson's supreme achievement_ are overshadowed when Jackson is mortally wounded by his own men. This loss is the true turning point of the war. Lee now realizes that against the evergrowing numbers of Union forces_ he can only win by a direct threat to Washington."

The Hardy Boys Detective Handbook,Fiction_Children & Young Adult_Mystery,"FOREWORD
Police science is one of the youngest and most rapidly growing professions in the United States today. I have revised this handbook for fans of Frank and Joe Hardy who are interested in learning about modern police practices.
The first seven chapters_ based upon true stories from police files_ illustrate how Frank and Joe use the various facets of police technology while tracking down criminals. Further uses of these techniques-fingerprinting_ surveillance_ and other related skills in the science of criminal investigation-are detailed in the last five chapters.
William F. Flynn_ FBI Special Agent who recently retired_ acted as my consultant in the preparation of this revised edition. It is our sincere hope that many readers of this handbook will someday join the ranks of our country's brave and dedicated law-enforcement officers who fight the never-ending war against crime.

You and your friend Running Foot decide to find kachinas_ spirits who will ask the gods to bring rain to your village.  As you climb down a rocky canyon trail_ you hear voices.  Through a clearing you see a group of enemy Apaches.  It looks like they are planning an attack!  What will you do?
A Choice of Gods,Fiction_Science_Technology_Aliens_Alien Invasion & Post-occupation,"One day they were there_ the next they were gone?all but a small tribe of American Indians_ a family and friends gathered for a party_ and the ubiquitous robots. Whatever mysterious power it was that had snatched up eight billion human souls and spirited them away had overlooked very few.

Deprived of a labor force_ technology disintegrated. The Indians went back to nature_ the others... something very strange happened to them. In exchange for the overpowering presence of the vanished hordes_ they acquired mental powers beyond imagining which whisked them through the stars_ extraordinary longevity_ and a painfully garnered wisdom.

As for the robots_ some went to live with the remnants of humanity_ though the Indians forthrightly rejected their services_ others gathered into a robot community and commenced work on the Project_ a work baffling to human understanding_ but in all its fantastic electronic complexity an apotheosis of robotry; still others_ a very few_ stubbornly maintained the old religion and lived as monks_ worshipping they knew not what by who knows what right.

Then one day a traveler returned from the stars. The people had been found and were planning to return. More important and more dreadful_ a Principle had been discovered in the center of the Galaxy_ a disembodied intelligence of awesome capacity and godlike indifference. The idyllic existence of the last of Earth's humans was threatened. The carefully composed elegy to mankind was under siege.

In this outstanding novel_ Clifford D. Simak has revealed a warmth_ a charm_ and a compassion rare in science fiction."

Surely there must be a way for love to flourish without  some poor unfortunate woman throwing herself in front of a train_ giving in to consumption_ being dumped_ or settling for Mr. Not-So-Right.

Then while you nap_ I will wash the dishes and prepare a light_ healthy snack to restore our expended energy.""

Brave Enemies,Fiction_Historical,"From the publisherAs the War for Independence wore on into the 1780s_ the Carolina upcountry was an extremely dangerous place to be. Settlers_ who had labored to clear the land after the Cherokee withdrew_ found themselves being mustered for battle as British forces infiltrated the forests and pillaged their hard-won farms.

Only sixteen years old_ Josie Summers dresses herself in her murdered stepfather's clothes to disguise herself as a man and runs away from her family farm. She is almost immediately lost in the impenetrable snowy woods and thus eagerly accepts a young Methodist preacher's invitation to assist in his itinerant ministry. When ""Joseph's"" true identity is revealed_ the very righteous Reverend John Trethman is racked with guilt at having shared his home with a young woman and_ even worse_ having fallen in love with her. His solution is to ""marry"" Josie_ performing as both minister and bridegroom.

When John is kidnapped by British soldiers and forced to minister to their wounded and bury their dead_ Josie is on her own once more. This time_ again disguised as a man_ she joins the north Carolina militia. On January 17_ 1781_ in a wooded pasture_ pregnant Josie is trapped in the battle known as Cowpens - the turning point of the Revolution - and despairs of ever seeing John again."

�s m�gis mozog a F�ld,Fiction_Historical_Renaissance_Fictional Biography,"The story of the life of Galileo Galilei.

Genius rarely seems genius when it appears in fiction; many an ambitious novelist has met disaster in attempting to portray a great man. But Galileo strides through these pages alive and full-blooded_ convincing every step of the way. We sense the almost unique power of his intellect almost from the moment we meet him - on the banks of the Arno_ in Florence_ contemplating suicide because of his father's insistence that he make medicine his career. And he might have killed himself had not the thought suddenly come that his floating body would contain certain quantities of air and water_ that one might measure these quantities_ that one might even construct - his mind soared - scales that would measure the proportion of the weight of double alloys. Suicide forgotten_ he rushed to Ricci_ the ducal tutor_ with his idea. The help he got_ and Ricci's enthusiasm for his invention_ made further study possible_ and he went on to the career in experimental philosophy that his soul craved.

From the first page the reader becomes immersed in the complex life of sixteenth-century Italy_ its sights and smells_ its plots and counterplots_ its intellectual enthusiasm_ the struggle of the Jesuits to keep within the bounds of orthodoxy this feverish quest for knowledge_ the vagaries of Medici rule_ and Papal politics. But the effect is never one of fancy dress. The novel takes its period for granted. In following Galileo from his beginning to his old age_ we see all phases of his life_ domestic_ political_ amorous_ spiritual."

Harmonia c�lestis,Fiction_General_Historical_20th Century,"Princes_ counts_ commanders_ diplomats_ bishops_ and patrons of the arts_ revered_ respected_ and occasionally feared by their contemporaries_ the Esterh�zy family was among the greatest and most powerful aristocrats in Hungarian history. Celestial Harmonies is the intricate chronicle of this remarkable family_ a story spanning seven centuries of epic conquest_ tragedy_ triumph_ and near annihilation.

Told by P�ter Esterh�zy_ a scion of this populous family_ Celestial Harmonies unfolds in two parts_ revealing two versions of the Esterh�zy story. Book One is a compilation of short passages about the Esterh�zy men_ sons reflecting on their fathers_ from the earliest days of the Hapsburg Empire to its demise in the early twentieth century and beyond. At one point_ the father is seen fighting the Turks and writing psalms_ at another he is described as herding geese and feathering his already well-feathered nest. In the nineteenth century_ he is caught cavorting with his mistress while looking after matters of state in the 1940s and 1950s_ he is seen helping to organize a number of conspiracies_ then reporting them (and himself) to the secret police. Conversely_ he is also seen apprehended and tortured by the authorities. The father is a monster and he is an angel_ but_ above all_ he is a man in search of his God.

Book Two chronicles the final chapter in the life of the Esterh�zy family_ from the short Communist takeover of 1919 to World War Two and its aftermath_ when Hungary fell to Soviet rule and the Esterh�zys succumbed to dispossession_ resettlement_ and impoverishment. Here_ Peter Esterh�zy reveals the story of his immediate family_ especially his father_ M�ty�s Esterh�zy_ who was born into great wealth and privilege in 1919. He worked as a field hand and parquet floor layer under the hard-line Communists_ then_ later on_ as a translator making a meager living. It is a biography of a man who_ despite the brutal tides of history_ never relinquished the humanist values that were his birthright_ and that were as inseparable from him as his illustrious name and heritage."
Egy n�,"Fiction_General_Literary Fiction/classics_Post-modern, Avant-garde, & Experimental","She Loves Me is Peter Esterhazy's paean to women: beautiful and ugly_ kind and nasty_ fat and bony_ monogamous and promiscuous_ seductive_ negative_ rebellious_ and voracious.

There's this woman. She loves me. I don't know who she is. We haven't been introduced. She's sitting across from me in the restaurant. If things should turn out as I hope_ we'd come here a lot_ and look down our noses at those couples who order the same things...

In ninety-seven short chapters this seductive novel contemplates love and desire and sex and hate_ all from the point of view of a manly narrator who considers himself a great and successful lover_ a womanizer_ a man who may - or may not - be in love with all of the women of the world.

There's this woman. She hates me. Her eyes are as grey as mine_ and since mine are as grey as my mother's_ when our eyes meet_ it's like I've made it home...

Intelligent and funny_ this book is a great declaration of love and of contempt_ and a philosophical exploration of the many postures and pretenses of eros. With his characteristic verbal pyrotechnics_ the serenely jaded Esterhazy proves that there will always be another romance_ and that love and hate spring from the same inexhaustible font.

There's this woman. She feels about me the way I feel about her. She loves me. She hates me. When she hates me_ I love her. When she loves me_ I hate her. All other eventualities are out of the question."

Like his siblings_ Archer is something of an expert when it comes to precious stones_ but until recently he made his living doing covert operations for Uncle Sam. It was during one such job that Archer discovered he had a half brother in the same business ? Len McGarry_ the result of a dalliance Archer's father had as a teenager. No sooner did Archer find Len then he very nearly lost him_ when an assignment went horribly wrong and nearly cost Len his life. Archer was able to save him_ but injuries condemned Len to a life as a bitter and mean-spirited paraplegic. In the process of rescuing Len_ Archer met and fell in love with Hannah_ Len's wife_ a fact Archer worked hard to hide. But Len caught on anyway and banished Archer from his life_ though not before giving him half ownership in a pearl farm Len owned ? a gesture of gratitude for saving his life. 

As a silent partner in the pearl farm_ Archer has little to do with it until he is awakened in the middle of the night 10 years later by a frantic yet wary phone call from Hannah informing him that Len is dead. While it appears that Len died from injuries sustained in a recent cyclone that struck Pearl Cove_ Hannah is certain he was murdered by someone who was after Len's prized collection of black rainbow pearls. Most of the pearls are missing_ including the prize of Len's collection_ the Black Trinity_ an exquisite three-strand necklace of black pearls. While Pearl Cove is suffering financial difficulties_ Len's secret for creating the one-of-a-kind black pearls which gleam beneath their lustrous surface with every color of the rainbow_ is worth billions of dollars. And there are plenty of interested parties who want to get that secret: the Aussies_ the Chinese_ the Japanese... even Uncle Sam himself. 

It doesn't take long for Archer and Hannah to confirm that Len's death was no accident_ and that Hannah is likely the next victim in line. Along with trying to find out where the missing pearls might be and who the killer is_ Archer is forced to deal with his feelings for Hannah_ which are more intense than ever. Hannah is also attracted to Archer_ but she has spent too many years trapped inside the bitter marriage she had with Len. With each cautious step they take_ they draw closer to discovering the missing jewels_ Len's murderer_ and the love they feel for one another."

These are the troubling words Serena Charters's grandmother has written on a note accompanying four pages of a centuries-old illuminated manuscript delivered after the old woman's passing.

The Diamond Tiger,Fiction_Romance_Suspense,"Sometimes_ if you're very lucky_ you can go home again. An earlier version of this book was titled The Diamond Tiger and came out in 1993 under the name Ann Maxwell. When my present publisher offered me the opportunity of going back to the novel under the name Elizabeth Lowell_ I admit that I hesitated. In the years since first publication_ the diamond trade has changed so greatly that it would be impossible to update the facts in the book without destroying the very story that had compelled me to write in the first place.

But like the diamond trade_ my style of telling a story has also changed over the years. I decided to revisit the novel because I loved it and hoped my new readers would as well. Death Is Forever is my favorite kind of story_ combining elements of danger_ greed_ trust_ secrets_ passions_ and death. Enjoy!"

A King of Infinite Space,Fiction_Science_Species Evolution_Longevity and Immortality_Technology_Nanotechnology,"Welcome to Heaven.  Here's a mop.

It's not that simple_ of course.  First you have to die.  Grunge rock_ bad acid_ and an eighteen-wheeler will do that.  Then you have to survive.

A Poet to His Beloved: The Early Love Poems of W.B. Yeats,Poetry_Verse_Love,"As a young man_ William Butler Yeats was deeply affected by the idea of romantic love_ or_ as he called it_ ""the old high way of love."" Characteristically_ much of his early poetry that which was written prior to 1910_ is poetry that belongs to courtship.

When Yeats was twenty-three years old_ he met and fell in love with the beautiful Irish nationalist_ Maud Gonne. Although she repeatedly refused to marry Yeats_ Maud would become the object of his passion and his poetry. The emotional power in many of Yeats' early poems is shaped by the one-sidedness of his affair with Maud_ but the poems themselves remain hopeful and bitter-sweet_ pure in their language and attitudes about love.

The forty-one poems collected in A Poet to His Beloved represent some of Yeats's most evocative and passionate early love poems. These versed are simple_ lyrical_ and often dreamy_ and they speak knowingly of innocence and beauty_ passion and desire_ devotion and the fear of rejection.

Everyman and Other Miracle and Morality Plays,Drama and Plays,"Western drama_ having all but disappeared during the Dark Ages_ reemerged spontaneously in the liturgy and life of the medieval church. Vernacular miracle plays of England's Middle Ages were performed by lay people - many by trade guilds - unschooled in church Latin_ but familiar with the Biblical events upon which the dramas were based. Morality plays provided moral instruction_ their principal characters vivid personifications of vice and virtue. The most durable of the morality plays has proven to be Everyman_ whose central character_ summoned by death_ must face final judgment on the strength of his good deeds.

The Ice-Shirt,"Fiction_Historical_Prehistoric Epics, Ancient Civilizations, and Precontact Native Americans","The time is the tenth century A.D. The newcomers are a proud and bloody-minded people whose kings once changed themselves into wolves. The Norse have advanced as implacably as as a glacier from Iceland to the wastes of Greenland - and from there to the place they call 'Vinland the Good.' The natives are a bronze-skinned race who have not yet discovered iron and still see themselves as part of nature.

As Vollmann tells the converging stories of these two peoples - and of the Norsewomen Freydis and Gudrid_ whose venomous rivalry brings frost into paradise - he creates a tour de force of 'speculative history_' a vivid amalgam of Icelandic saga_ Inuit creation myth_ and contemporary travel writing that yields a new and utterly original vision of our continent and its past."

The Best of Saki,Fiction_General_Humor,"No writer has combined laughter with savagery more devastatingly than Saki. Though he died sixty years ago_ the blackness of his comedy is contemporary and his wit has lost none of its freshness and sparkle.

Albino,Fiction_General_Literary Fiction/classics,"""I am different. I am different. I am different. I wrote it on a piece of paper. In the evening I would take the paper out of my pocket and look at it..."" Sebestyen's novel is the story of a young man whose physical appearance proclaims to the world that he stands apart from the norm. Everything is seen through the eyes of the albino protagonist. His physical vulnerability is matched by a psychological sensitivity which Sebestyen uses to present his protagonist's response to his environment and his predicament with a movingly lyrical intensity.

The albino could stand for any outsider. The novel does not examine the hostility or persecution that creates the outsider_ but focuses on the debilitating effect on a person of being unable to belong to normal society."
Die Werke der Einsamkeit,Fiction_General_Literary Fiction/classics,"This work belongs to the Austrian tradition of large-scale novels in which Austria becomes a stage on which human dramas of the widest significance are played out_ a tradition going back to Robert Musil's The Man without Qualities. The narrative is multifaceted. Against the pessimistic satirical portrayal of public life are set the hero's practical attempts to foster a sense of the organic unity of life through his teaching. They are ""works of solitude_"" actions which proceed from a sense of individual value rather than conforming to the homogenized standards of modern society."

Erben des Feuers,Fiction_General_Regional Interest,The novel_ which paints a picture of Vienna of the 1950s_ contains a crime mystery of a sort. It introduces a gallery of colorful characters struggling to come to grips with the history of their country with its shifting boundaries of wealth and class.

Simple conclusions about the characters' lives or the city they live in may capture part of the truth_ but never all the nuances.

Die Tapetent�r,Fiction_General_Literary Fiction/classics_Troubled Lives,"In this novel the protagonist struggles with almost solipsistic isolation_ alternating with a delight in solitude and routine. In narrative form punctuated by diary entries_ the author describes in plain_ almost prosaic detail these struggles and the ultimately futile attempt Annette makes to escape their cycle.

Schlangenkind,Fiction_General_Regional Interest_Youth,Serpent's Child is a coming-of-age novel that is set in a farming village near Klagenfurt and in Salzburg during the later 1970s. Its sure sense of place and time and its psychological acuity suggest the intimacy of autobiographical experience that knows how traditions of patriarchal abuse and the dictates of conformity disfigure a seemingly idyllic milieu. A person of inquisitive intelligence_ Truschner's protagonist observes the dynamics of dysfunctional relationships with_ by turns_ the dispassionate objectivity of an outsider and the tenderness of a wounded_ disoriented sensitivity in search of human closeness. His story is told as a fast-paced sequence of interconnected episodes_ some brief and self-contained_ others recaptured at later moments and expanded in new directions as perspectives shift and attitudes and insights change. It is a vivid account_ forceful in its evocation of the domestic and other social details that make every one of the outrageous and endearing characters and the drama of their psychological conflicts persuasive_ and at the same time restrained by a subtle sense of self-irony and compassion. Most remarkable_ however_ is the narrator's invention of images. His fondness for extended metaphors and analogous similes charges his language with an explosive and at times extravagant energy and thus speaks for the continued artistic vigor of a fictional genre that has been an Austrian obsession for decades.
