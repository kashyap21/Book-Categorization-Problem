Murder Most Catholic: Divine Tales of Profane Crimes,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Religious_Christianity_Edward D.  Hoch_Ed  Gorman_Stephen  Dentinger,"The murder mysteries that make up this unusual anthology all have one thing in common: the hero or heroine who solves the crime is a Catholic cleric. Perhaps that should not be surprising_ for since the time of G. K. Chesterton those who have explored stories with a religious belief or background have tended to place them in the Middle Ages. And during that time most Christians were in one way or another connected to the Catholic church. From Chestertons classic priest-turned-detective Father Brown to Peter Tremaynes historical Celtic nun and lawyer_ Sister Fidelma_ religious men and women put aside their professional duties for a moment to take up an altogether different vocation for a short timethat of detective and solver of crimes unspeakable.

Master of the Five Magics,"Fiction_Fantasy_Paranormal Powers_Wizards, Sorcerers, Enchantresses. Etc.","To master five greats arts of magic and win a queen was not enough for Alodar the apprentice. He must do what no man dared! 

Alodar was a mere apprentice thaumaturge_ learning the least of the five great arts of magic. As such_ h had no right to aspire to the hand of the fair lady_ Queen Vendora_ not even when he saved her during demon-inspired seige of her frontier castle. But aspire he did.

His quest forced him from one exacting branch of magic to another_ with the rewards he earned always going to others. Finally_ only the branch of wizardry remained - the great_ almost lost art of controlling demons.

It was then he learned of the ancient plot behind his rise - and faced the greatest danger any man could dare!

Alodar's quest is not only a stirring tale of adventure_ but also one of the most logical detailings of the laws of magic ever to appear in fantasy."
Blood Price,Fiction_Fantasy_Dark Fantasy_Fantasy Featuring Detection_Horror_Vampires_Detectives and Horror,"Set in Toronto_ Ontario_ Canada. This book follows the courageous and hard-headed Vicki Nelson_ a private investigator_ formerly of Toronto's homicide detail. 
As she delves into a series of seemingly unstoppable murders_ she teams up with a writer of romance novels_ Henry Fitzroy_ but there's more to him than meets the eye (as Vicki's suspicious on-again-off-again boyfriend_ Det. Mike Celluci suspects)but Fitzroy is not an ordinary man at all_ for he is a vampire."
Daughter of the Blood,Fiction_Fantasy_Sword and Sorcery_Dark Fantasy,"The world of the Black Jewels Trilogy is one filled with magic_ governed by Queens and their courts of powerful Warlords. Over the recent centuries_ a slow creeping taint has filled the Realm of Light. Strong-willed_ deeply magical warlords have been warped and repressed by a witch who hopes to harness them to her tainted cause_ until they perpetuate the very corruption they fear. The High Lord of Hell is the only one strong enough (and free enough) to overcome her_ but he's over 50_000 years old and tired of unlife. 

A prophesy from a half-crazed witch declares that the Dark Queen is coming_ she who can cleanse all the realms. And she does come_ 700 years after her foretelling. She'll fulfill the wishes of countless dreamers-- if they can keep her safe from the taint long enough to reach her full power. Otherwise_ she'll be the embodiment of all their nightmares."
The Awakening Water,Fiction_Children & Young Adult_Science Fiction_Futuristic Societies,"Thirteen-year-old John has never questioned his life of back-breaking work for the District Leader-- until the day he meets the wild girl and tastes the forbidden water. Cool_ clear spring water_ utterly unlike the sickly liquid John has always known_ it gives him a new aliveness_ awakens him to both hope and fear... and impells him to escape.

He joins others who have fled from the Party_ and with them he develops an awareness of himself_ of other people_ and of the world around him. The more he learns about the ways the Party has ""kept everyone quiet and working"" since it came to power in 1997_ the more precarious his new-found freedom seems--and the more precious.

A sort of ""1984"" for children and young adults_ though grown-ups can enjoy it as well."
March to the Stars,Fiction_Science Fiction_Adventure_Militaristic,"Roger Ramius Sergei Alexander Chiang MacClintock has had a really bad year. 

Bad enough to be the spoiled rotten fop of a prince no one wanted or trusted.


Worse to be sent off on a meaningless diplomatic mission_ simply to get you out from underfoot_ with a bodyguard of Marines who loathe and despise you.


Worse yet to be assumed dead and marooned for almost a year on a hell-hole planet while you and those same Marines fight your way through carnivorous beasts_ murderous natives_ and perpetual rain to the only starport. . . which is controlled by the Empire's worst enemies.


Worst of all to have discovered that you were born to be a warrior prince. One whose bodyguards have learned the same lesson. And one haunted by the deaths of almost a hundred of your Marines... for what you know now was an unnecessary exercise in political expediency.


A warrior prince who wants to have a few choice words with your Lady Mother_ the Empress of Man.


But to have them_ you_ your surviving Marines_ and your Mardukan allies must cross a demon-haunted ocean_ face a civilization that is ""civilized"" in name alone and ""barbarians"" who may not be exactly what they seem_ and once again battle against impossible odds. All so that you can attempt to somehow seize a heavily defended spaceport and hijack a starship to take you home.


Yet what neither Roger_ nor the Marines_ nor his allies know is that the battle to leave Marduk is only the beginning. And that words with Roger's mother will be hard to come by.


But that's all right. Because what the Galaxy doesn't know is that it's about to receive a fresh proof of an old truism:


You don't mess with a MacClintock."
Dial-a-Ghost,Fiction_Children & Young Adult_Horror_Ghosts,"The Dial-a-Ghost Agency finds good homes for ghosts.  Bloodstained brides_ headless warriors_ bloblike ghouls-ghosts of every sort are matched with living families.  There are two doors to the agency's offices: one marked GHOSTS_ the other marked PEOPLE.  Through the first door come the Wilkinsons_ a nice family of spooks who are fed up with haunting a knicker shop (the lacy slips and rudely named tights are not good for ghost children to be around!).  Through the second door comes Fulton Snodde-Brittle_ who wants the wickedest ghosts available for his grand home_ Helton Hall. 

Luckily the agency ladies_ Miss Pringle and Mrs. Mannering_ have just the right match for each customer.  They send the Wilkinsons off to a tranquil old abbey and promise Fulton Snodde-Brittle a pair of appalling spooks_ the Shriekers_ who wear rotten meat as jewelry and like to strangle children in their sleep.  What the kindly ladies don't know is that Fulton has an evil scheme to frighten his young cousin_ the heir to Hulton Hall_ to death.  Poor Oliver doesn't stand a chance against the Shriekers_ but maybe the agency isnt as well organized as it seems."
The Magic Circle,Fairy Tales & Folklore_Reinterpretations,Deep in the woods lives an old witch called Ugly One.  All she wants is to forget-that she once was a loving mother and healer_ blessed and powerful within her magic circle_ and not a witch_ claimed by the devils.  Then one day she hears the footsteps she dreads.  Then real voices-childrens voices.  The Ugly One longs to take care of sturdy_ sensible Gretel and her young brother Hansel.  They are such good children_ such delicious_ beautiful children.  But demons voices scream in her head: Eat them! How can she?...How can she not?
Darkchild,Fiction_Science Fiction_Science Fantasy,For these hundred centuries_ women of wisdom and strength have mastered the sunstones to bring warmth and wealth to their people. But while the Brakrathi tended their stonehalls and valleys_ others have traversed the spaces between the stars with less gentle motives. Like the arrogant Arnini_ who study and measure eveything but understand nothing of the human soul. Or the benderzic_ who ruthlessly harvest information from their army of child informants and auction it to the highest bidder. Until the coming of Darkchild. Until the end of the beginning of things.
Bluesong,Fiction_Science Fiction_Science Fantasy,Her hair was the colour of night_ her eyes at once bright and dark...And the bluesong - when the sun was bright it came to her as if it sang in the trees_ a high_ wordless yearning_ and it called Keva to the search. So Keva left her home among the weedfishers for uncharted hardlands. It was there that she met Danior and together they discovered their power - and the bluesong that sang them to the stars.
Starsilk,Fiction_Science Fiction_Science Fantasy,Rainbow-hued bowers in high treetops.  Golden eyes behind silkswaths of trilling scarlet.  From the heart of the forest the lifesong of a man calls out to the daughter he has never seen. In Valley Terlath_ Reyna holds the whitesilk that echoes that wordless song. She will never sit on the sunthrone of her mothers_ yet in its plaint lies her birthright.

Oxford Book of American Detective Stories,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives_General_Edgar Allan  Poe_Bret  Harte_Cornell  Woolrich_Dorothy Salisbury  Davis_Edward D.  Hoch_Linda  Barnes_Marcia  Muller,"Edited by: Tony Hillerman and Rosemary Herbert

Edgar Allan Poe's ""Murders in the Rue Morgue"" launched the detective story in 1841. The genre began as a highbrow form of entertainment_ a puzzle to be solved by a rational sifting of clues. In Britain_ the stories became decidedly upper crust: the crime often committed in a world of manor homes and formal gardens_ the blood on the Persian carpet usually blue. But from the beginning_ American writers worked important changes on Poe's basic formula_ especially in use of language and locale.

In The Oxford Book of American Detective Stories_ Tony Hillerman and Rosemary Herbert bring together thirty-three tales that illuminate both the evolution of crime fiction in the United States and America's unique contribution to this highly popular genre. From elegant ""locked room"" mysteries_ to the hard-boiled realism of the '30s and '40s_ to the great range of styles seen today_ this superb collection includes the finest crime writers_ including Erle Stanley Gardner_ Raymond Chandler_ Ross Macdonald_ Rex Stout_ Ellery Queen_ Ed McBain_ Sue Grafton_ and Hillerman_ a best-selling crime writer himself. And we sample a wide variety of styles_ from tales with a strongly regional flavor_ to hard-edged pulp fiction_ to stories with a feminist perspective.

Throughout_ the editors provide highly knowledgeable introductions to each piece_ written from the perspective of fellow writers and reflecting a life-long interest--not to say love--of this quintessentially American genre. Hillerman and Herbert bring us a gold mine of glorious stories that can be read for sheer pleasure_ but that also illuminate how the crime story evolved from the drawing room to the back alley_ and how it came to explore every corner of our nation and every facet of our lives.

Murder Most Delectable,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Crime/Caper_Pat  McMahon_Bill  Crider_Walter  Satterthwait_M.D.  Lake_Joyce Carol  Oates_Barbara  D'Amato,"What a grand love affair people have with food_ the only thing that can simultaneously delight all five senses. The sound of a porterhouse steak as it sizzles on the grill... the sight of a golden brown turkey roasting in the oven... the cool feel of watermelon on a steamy day... the smell of apple pie as it bakes to perfection...all fill us with delight and joy. But the final most glorious sensetasteis sated with the first delectable bite.

Some people's appetite for food is exceeded only by their appetite for crime. As our demand for creative dishes has increased_ so has the opportunity for evil epicureans to combine their talent for wickedness with their love of good food and drink. Thus they are able to lay their victims low in one fell swoop_ using nothing more than a well-cooked meal or specially concocted libation.

This menu of eighteen stories of culinary crimes and death beckons everyone. Readers are advised to quiet any hunger pangs before turning the pages_ for the meals described may be worth dying for. As an added bonus_ recipes pertinent to each story's flavor are included_ making this savory concoction_ indeed_ a true collection of Murder Most Delectable.

Death by Espionage,Fiction_Adventure_Spy/Espionage_Crime and Mystery_Suspense_Mark  Twain_John D.  MacDonald_John  Lutz_Edward D.  Hoch,"So few spies reach retirement age. Perhaps that's because the first rule of the game is that everybody dies- well_ almost everybody. The quest for information makes for complex and particularly interesting characters_ and at least a few of them survive to enjoy the ill-gotten fruit of their labors. Or is it ill-gotten?

The stories in DEATH BY ESPIONAGE come from the imaginations of members of the International Association of Crime Writers and some of the world's best-known authors. Their agents stealthily slip in and out of this collection of twenty stories with settings ranging from a Civil War outpost and Victorian England to Hitler's Fortress Europa and the post-Cold War world. The stories delve into themes of betrayal_ revenge_ and treachery and demonstrate the mind games and manipulations for which spies are so renowned.

These stories brim with missions behind enemy lines_ red herrings_ Swiss bank accounts_ ingenious entrapments_ and coded instructions. There are German spies in America and Allied spies in Europe during World War II. There are Israeli spies and spies in Latin America. There are assassins and seducers_ stolen plans and intricate games of cat and mouse. And there are grudges. The universal rule_ however_ is that no one gets to write their memoirs.

We follow Winfield Scott Hancock_ a Captain of Quartermasters who is assigned command of a brigade of infantry_ quickly establishing himself as one of the finest leaders in the Union army. Then there is Joshua Chamberlain_ who gives up his promising academic career to volunteer for service in the new army_ only to become one of the most heroic soldiers in American history.

Lee_ who is faced with the agonizing decision of resigning from a distinguished thirty-year army career in order to defend his home_ never believing until too late that a civil war would ever truly come to pass. As the war gathers momentum_ Stonewall Jackson wins his reputation by a series of stinging victories over ineptly led Union forces.

The Hardy Boys Detective Handbook,Fiction_Children & Young Adult_Mystery,"FOREWORD
Police science is one of the youngest and most rapidly growing professions in the United States today. I have revised this handbook for fans of Frank and Joe Hardy who are interested in learning about modern police practices.
The first seven chapters_ based upon true stories from police files_ illustrate how Frank and Joe use the various facets of police technology while tracking down criminals. Further uses of these techniques-fingerprinting_ surveillance_ and other related skills in the science of criminal investigation-are detailed in the last five chapters.
William F. Flynn_ FBI Special Agent who recently retired_ acted as my consultant in the preparation of this revised edition. It is our sincere hope that many readers of this handbook will someday join the ranks of our country's brave and dedicated law-enforcement officers who fight the never-ending war against crime.
F.W.D."

The only clue in the case leads the two young detectives to South America_ where the intrigues of evil adversaries almost cost them their lives. Involved in this complex mystery are a fierce-looking monkey trained to be a killer_ a school of voracious_ man-eating piranhas_ a ruthless gang of passport thieves_ and a cleverly operated change-your-identity mill for criminals.

Are gangsters hounding them to force Mr. Hardy to give up his investigation of an international crime syndicate? Or are the boys' sinister foes also seeking the helmet?

They are shadowed_ trapped_ sprung upon by a huge black dog_ and smitten by an old crone's curse. Who are their enemies? The same people who burglarized the professor's witch Museum and robbed him of his life's investment? When the Hardys learn about the strange disappearance of Lord Craighead_ the plot deepens. Danger lurks everywhere and follows them to Ireland and the Isle of Man.
After surviving a shipwreck in the storm-tossed Irish Sea_ the clue of a frightened white witch leads them into the torture chamber of a black witches' coven.

Their search on both counts seems futile. They return to the United States_ where they uncover new clues that take them to Mexico and a breathtaking adventure at an archaeological dig in the Yucatan jungle.
But the Hardys' travels lead to nothing but new doubts and nagging suspicions. And now their lives are in danger. Their adversaries are cunning_ elusive_ and determined to eliminate Mr. Hardy_ and the boys too!

Edward Hoch_ Keith Taylor_ and Cherith Baldry also turn such familiar historical figures as Christopher Columbus_ John de Mandeville_ and Geoffrey Chaucer into detectives in this new Mammoth collection of historical mysteries.

Ransom,Fiction_Romance_Historical_Medieval,"In the dark days after the death of Richard the Lionhearted_ lives and lands would fall into upheaval at the hands of a power-hungry British ruler and his violent minions. One victim of the scourge is innocent Gillian_ who is a mere child when the cruel and ambitious Baron Alford slaughters her father and tears her family apart. Alford_ determined to recover a jeweled box for the despotic King John_ is furious when the precious treasure slips through his fingers -- only to be lost for more than a decade.

Now a beautiful young woman_ Gillian finds the key to resolving her past in handsome Scottish chieftains Ramsey Sinclair and Brodick Buchanan. With the cunning and courage of the daring Scotsmen_ and with the friendship of a new ally_ Bridgid KirkConnell_ Gillian at last fights the unscrupulous Baron Alford_ laying claim to her home_ her family_ and her father's reputation. But in the presence of the mighty warrors_ Gillian and Bridgid discover that desire can be a weapon of conquest...betrayal can slay trust in a heartbeat...and the greatest risk of all is surrender -- to the deep emotions of unexpected love.(from the publisher)"
The Secret,Fiction_Romance_Historical_Sweet-and-savage,"Judith Hampton was as beautiful as she was proud and loyal. Her dear Scottish friend from childhood was about to give birth_ and Judith had promised to be at her side. But there was another_ private reason for the journey from her bleak English home to the Highlands: to meet the father she had never known_ the Laird Maclean. Nothing prepared her_ however_ for the sight of the Scottish barbarian who was to escort her into his land...I ain Maitland_ Laird of his clan_ a man more powerfully compelling than any she had ever encountered. 

In a spirited clash of wills and customs_ Judith reveled in the melting bliss of Iain's searching kisses_ his passionate caresses. Perplexed by her sprightly defiance_ bemused by her tender nature_ Iain felt his soul growing into the light and warmth of her love. Surely nothing would wrench her from the affection and trust of Iain and his clan... not even the truth about her father_ a devastating secret that could shatter the boldest alliance_ and the most glorious of loves!"
The Bride,Fiction_Romance_Historical_Medieval,"By edict of the king_ the mighty Scottish laird Alec Kincaid must take an English bride. His choice was Jamie_ youngest daughter of Baron Jamison...a feisty_ violet-eyed beauty. Alec ached to touch her_ to tame her_ to possess her...forever. But Jamie vowed never to surrender to this highland barbarian.

He was everything her heart warned againstan arrogant scoundrel whose rough good looks spoke of savage pleasures. And thought Kincaid's scorching kisses fired her blood_ she brazenly resisted him...until one rapturous moment quelled their clash of wills_ and something far more dangerous than desire threatened to conquer her senses..."
The Wedding,Fiction_Romance_Historical_Medieval,"Lady Brenna MacAlister harbored no illusions that her husband_ a quick-tempered highland laird_ was in love with her. How could he be enamored of his bride when_ on their wedding day_ he had assured her that she could return to her home in England as soon as she had given him a son? Marrying Connor MacAlister had been an impulsive act for Brenna. But MacAlister and his warriors_ a savage-looking band who had captured her and her party en route to her arranged marriage to another_ offered precious few alternatives. Nor could Brenna deny that in fact she had proposed to MacAlister even if that had been ten long years ago_ when she was just a child_ and Connor a visitor to her father's castle. Actually_ Brenna scarcely remembered the secret missives she'd sent to MacAlister_ abetted by her mischievous older sister...yet she had never forgotten the tall visitor's dazzling_ unexpected smile. Now_ after a hasty forest wedding_ they were man and wife. Determined to be happy_ Brenna soon endeared herself to most of the clan_ despite or perhaps because of - her uncanny knack for getting into trouble. And although she grew to adore her brave_ superstitious_ gentle husband_ she had no clue that Connor lived for the moments she whispered ""I love you""...words she never meant him to hear. But when a rival laird struck out at the MacAlisters_ trapping Brenna in a web of dangerous intrigue_ she knew that only her faith in her gallant mate could save her...."
The Prize,Fiction_Romance_Historical_Medieval,"In the resplendence of William the Conqueror's London court_ the lovely Saxon captive_ Nichola was forced to choose a husband from the assembled Norman nobles. She chose Royce_ a baron warrior whose fierce demeanor could not conceal his chivalrous and tender hear.

The Moor's Last Sigh,Fiction_General Fiction,"Booker Prize-winning author Salman Rushdie combines a ferociously witty family saga with a surreally imagined and sometimes blasphemous chronicle of modern India and flavors the mixture with peppery soliloquies on art_ ethnicity_ religious fanaticism_ and the terrifying power of love. Moraes ""Moor"" Zogoiby_ the last surviving scion of a dynasty of Cochinese spice merchants and crime lords_ is also a compulsive storyteller and an exile. As he travels a route that takes him from India to Spain_ he leaves behind a tale of mad passions and volcanic family hatreds_ of titanic matriarchs and their mesmerized offspring_ of premature deaths and curses that strike beyond the grave."
Sister Gypsy Moon,Fiction_Romance_Romantic-Suspense,"The crumbling purple house_ wedged into an obscure Dallas neighborhood_ seems the perfect place for Gypsy Larabee to hide from her abusive ex-boyfriend. But the house harbors dangerous secrets_ and her investigation into the missing homeowner's whereabouts proves hazardous to Gypsy's health. Gypsy's troubles begin when she is mistaken for Ruby_ the absentee homeowner_ who was a fortuneteller. A few of Gypsy's chance comments prove eerily prescient_ and soon she has a hoard of paying customers at her door. But her crystal-ball reading brings on the wrath of her ultra-religious neighbors_ a media frenzy_ and a violent gang member who is obsessed with the purple house. 

Add to Gypsy's problem her control freak lawyer sister_ Petal_ who moves in after her husband locks her out of her Highland Park mansion_ and the quietly obscure existence Gypsy dreamed of is in fragments. Her discovery of Ruby's body thrusts her already chaotic life into a new direction_ as solving the mystery becomes a matter of survival. 

The mysterious events gradually increase the pressure. Gypsy tries and fails to field every pop fly that comes her way until her life becomes impossibly tangled. The mystery is complex_ as are the relationships in Gypsy's life_ especially the ones with her sister and a certain_ hot-blooded reporter whose motives are never quite clear. An intricately textured story with potential to lead into a continuing series."
The Wrong Box,Fiction_General Fiction_Humor,"The Wrong Box (1889) is one of Stevenson's strangest works. Written with his stepson Lloyd Osbourne_ it is a masterpiece of black comedy_ turning on mistaken identity_ the disappearance of a corpse_ and several makeshift coffins.

V.S. Pritchett described it as 'a farce that slips down the throat with the nicety of an oyster'; to E.F. Benson it was 'perhaps the most superb extravaganza in the language.'

The Finsbury family has long been involved in a Tontinea scheme in which subscribers invest money in a fund which then falls to the last survivor. Now there are only two aged uncles between Morris and John Finsbury and their fortune. A railway accident appears to dispose of one; and then the farce begins...

In this eccentric and brilliantly plotted story the authors extended the boundaries of good taste. The Wrong Box perplexed some of its Victorian readers; a century on it is less shocking but the comedy is deft as ever."
Felicia's Journey,Fiction_General Fiction_Troubled Lives,Felicia is unmarried_ pregnant_ and penniless. She steals away from a small Irish town and drifts through the industrial English Midlands_ searching for the boyfriend who left her. Instead she meets up with the fat_ fiftyish_ unfailingly reasonable Mr. Hilditch_ who is looking for a new friend to join the five other girls in his Memory Lane. But the strange_ sad_ terrifying tricks of chance unravel both his and Felicia's delusions.
The Archivist,"Fiction_General Fiction_Books, Scholars, And Librarians",Matthias is a librarian_ a man of orderly ways_ responsible for safeguarding a sealed cache of T.S. Elliot's letters. Roberta is a young poet with an unabashed and oddly intense interest in the letters. What begins as a battle of wills soon evolves into an unlikely friendshipa relationship that not only unsettles Matthias's solitary life but forces him to confront long-buried memories of his wife_ her mental breakdown_ and the dissolution of their marriage. Propelled by startling truths hidden and revealed_ this extraordinary novel draws richly upon the poems of T.S. Elliot and the intellectual and social climate of postwar New York City as it explores the redemptive power of art and the challenge of forging a moral and meaningful life in the modern world.
Deathknight,Fiction_Fantasy_Shared Worlds,They are the knights of the Order Most Old. Feared. Respected. Obeyed. And perhaps hated - by one who would destroy the Order Most Old and disrupt the fragile unity of Sij. Falc of Risskor must bring to justice the slayer of the knights or be killed himself.

John Dough and the Cherub,Fiction_Children & Young Adult_Fantasy,"When this whimsically fantastic tale by the author of the great Oz series first appeared_ it was surrounded by a mystery. Was Chick the Cherub_ one of the story's main characters_ a boy or a girl? The book never tells_ so young readers were asked to decide_ with the best answers being awarded cash prizes.

Though the answer was never satisfactorily resolved (and readers today will doubtless have their own ideas on the matter)_ it is still an ingenious story_ full of delightful Baum characters. There is John Dough_ the human-size gingerbread man who was brought to life by an Arab Elixir_ and has a tendency to crumble when it rains. (He lost  a heel just by walking across wet grass!) And there is Chick_ the world's first incubator baby; Para Bruin_ a rubber bear_ who loves to roll himself up in a ball and bounce down from great heights; the wicked Mifkets_ the Island Princess and many more.

The entertaining adventures of these curious creatures as they travel from the Island of Phreex to the Palace of Romance_ finally winding up in the kingdom of Hilo (or is it Lohi?)_ are certain to amuse all readers_ both young and old alike. Like The Wizard of OZ and other Baum adventures_ it is full of delightful humor."
The Playboy of the Western World,Drama and Plays_Irish_John M. Synge,First produced in 1907_ this play sent shock waves through the dramatic world_ pushing the limits of decency and stoking an already red-hot nationalistic fire. Though met with near instant rioting and controversy_ it is now considered a masterpiece of poetic drama.

Murder Most Merry,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Crime/Caper_Arthur Conan  Doyle_Edward D.  Hoch_Peter  Lovesey,"Edited by: Abigail Browning
A great holiday gift for mystery fans_ this short story collection of over thiry tales of Christmas crime contains contributions from the world's leading mystery writers_ including John D. MacDonald_ Georges Simenon_ Margery Allingham_ Lawrence Block_ John Mortimer_ Patricia Moyes_ Rex Stout_ Edward D. Hoch_ James Powell_ and many others.  From sinister Santas involved in who-done-its_ to a grandma sleuth investigating a missing Christmas bear_ these varied stories explode the traditions of the season whilesurprisinglyoften reflecting them.
In ""Murder Under the Mistletoe_"" a revenge killing on Christmas Eve leads to the solving of an infamous jewel robbery.  John Mortimer's Rumpole of the Bailey makes his appearance in two cases focusing on the kindness of the Christmas spirit.  An eyewitness to a robbery is ""Dead on Christmas Street_"" but the obvious suspects seem more like bad boys than killers.  A stand-in St. Nick meets the real Grim Reaper in a department store's Elfin Grove in Patricia Moyes' ""Who Killed Father Christmas?""  Edward D. Hoch's Nick Velvet helps a mother and daughter solve a yuletide riddle involving cryptic messages in a Christmas stocking.  And in ""Grists for the Mills of Christmas_"" a writer investigating the disappearance of holiday travelers finds out firsthand the connection between vanishing people and a murderous legend of Christmas yore.  
These Christmas tales with a malicious twistlike ""I Saw Mommy Killing Santa Claus""will chase the humbug out of your holiday.  And after reading these stories_ you will understand why you should never turn your back on an elf.  So beware of hanging mistletoe and stuffed stockings this season_ as you celebrate a creepy Christmas with Murder Most Merry.

Murder Most Divine: Ecclesiastical Tales of Unholy Crimes,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Religious_Christianity_Edward D.  Hoch_Antonia  Fraser_Neil  Gaiman_Kathleen  Dougherty,"Edited by: Ralph McInerny and Martin H. Greenberg

Among the Ten Commandments_ ""Thou Shalt Not Kill"" is self-evidently the most basic and fundamental.  Even so_ there are those who would break that commandment with impunity_ as there are also those who enthusiastically break them all.  Sometimes the men and women who seek out and bring these transgressors to justice are people of the cloth_ whose explorations of the mysteries of the divine uniquely qualify them to uncover the frailties of their fellow man.  From G.K. Chesterton's classic priest-turned-detective Father Brown to Andrew Greeley's modern day Chicago priest Father ""Blackie"" Ryan_ occasionally religious men and women put aside their professional duties to take up an altogether different vocation for a short time -- that of detective.  Murder Most Divine contains eighteen superb stories of such sleuthing_ resulting in a kind of justice that is almost heavenly in its reach.

Packed into the teeming holds of His Majesty's ships_ they sailed treacherous seas to the icy desolation of Antarctica_ to the South Cape of Tasmania_ to Captain Cook's anchorage in Botany Bay.
It was a cruel_ violent fate for fifteen-year-old Jenny Taggart.  Falsely accused of theft_ she was torn from her loved ones_ a beautiful child among hardened convicts_ an innocent in the craft of survival.
Betrayed by her beauty_ sustained by courage_ she would endure to become Queen of the Convicts_ target of passion and vengeance in a raw_ merciless_ land..."
Queen Zixi of Ix or The Story of the Magic Cloak,Fiction_Children & Young Adult_Fantasy,"When the renowned author of the wonderful Oz stories surpasses himself with a full-blown fairy tale_ complete with magic wishes_ palace life_ an evil hag_ and a poor boy and girl_ we know we are in for something exceptional in story-telling. ""In some ways_"" Baum confided to his son_ ""Queen Zixi is my best effort."" The critic Edward Wagenknecht goes further_ terming it flatly one of the best fairy tales ever written by anyone.

The master tale-spinner captures suspenseful attention at once with a magic wishing cloak which the fairies decide to give to the first unhappy mortal -- man_ woman_ or child -- their emissary chances to meet. At the same time_ the King of Noland has died without heir_ and the law says that the new King shall be the forty-seventh person who happens to pass through the city gates that day. In the neighboring kingdom of Ix_ malevolent Queen Zixi_ six hundred and eighty-three years old and smug in the secrets of witchcraft_ craves that magic cloak with all her heart. And that morning_ a humble ferryman's son_ Bud_ happens to be on his way to the city with his pretty sister Fluff...

All who know the enchantment that a real fairy tale can hold for a child will recognize here the ingredients of a spellbinder. Add to them the well-known gifts of the author in creating captivating characters_ sparkling fantasy_ rich humor_ and inventive absurdity_ and a true classic of juvenile literature emerges to fascinate both child and parent. The story was originally illustrated with 90 images drawn by Frederic Richardson_ and serialized in St. Nicholas Magazine."
A New Wonderland,Fiction_Children & Young Adult_Fantasy,This story expounds upon the many strange adventures of the Magical Monarch in the Valley of Mo.  Baum's storytelling skills were top notch when this work was written_ and the story is considered by many to be his best non-Oz work.  A delight for both parents and their children.

Murder on Deck!,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives_Peter  Lovesey_Edward D.  Hoch,"Edited by: Rosemary Herbert

The sea itself has always been a mystery--cold_ dark_ vast_ and unfathomable--indifferent to human wishes and perilous to the ill-prepared. So what more appropriate setting for the ultimate human mystery_ the seemingly unsolvable murder.

In Murder on Deck! Rosemary Herbert proves that the opulence of the cruise ship and seaside resort has attracted some of the greatest writers in the genre. From Sir Arthur Conan Doyle_ Agatha Christie_ and Viola Brothers Shore to William Faulkner_ Ellery Queen_ John Mortimer_ Susan Moody_ and many others_ Murder on Deck! offers 25 stories that plumb the depths of ghastly crimes. Many of these stories take place on luxury liners_ or holiday shorelines_ where mostly privileged vacationers have sought a pleasant and highly civilized escape from their daily lives. Imagine their chagrin when murder is thrust into their midst and the high tide of anxiety rolls in. Our detectives_ too_ are often on vacation_ taking time off from pondering the impenetrable and are thus forced into a busman's holiday of restoring order and calm to a shattered idyll. In addition to acclaimed stories in English_ Murder on Deck! sails into international waters with stories by Gabriel Garcia Marquez (Colombia)_ Saho Sasazawa (Japan)_ and for the first time ever in English_ Chris Rippen (The Netherlands). Dutch author Janwillem van de Wetering rewrote his 1985 story ""Messing About in Boats_"" especially for this anthology.

A marvelous collection for the mystery lover or armchair traveler_ and perfect reading for any vacation_ especially the ocean cruise or trip to the beach_ Murder on Deck! weighs anchor and heads for the high seas of unforgettable intrigue and watertight suspense.

Ravenmocker,Fiction_Crime and Mystery,"The most brutal serial killer the FBI has ever encountered is murdering descendents of a particular Cherokee tribe. As the number of bizarre killings spread across the Southern United States_ authorities are clueless. Their tribal search leads them to Steven Waters and his cousin_ Morgan Roberts.

But their experiment goes incredibly awry_ and_ for a few moments_ the consciousness of the entire human race is thrown ahead by about twenty years. While humanity must deal immediately with the destructive aftermath of the experiment - thousands were injured and killed as every single person's body was left unconscious in the here-and-now - the greater implications take longer to surface. People who had no vision of the future seek to learn how they will die_ while others seek out future lovers. Lloyd must deal with the guilt of accidentally causing the death of his financee's child_ while Theo gets caught up in the search for his own murderer. As the implications truly hit home_ the pressure to repeat the experiment builds. Everyone wants a glimpse of the future_ a chance to flashforward and see their successes ... or learn how to avoid their failures.

Hominids,Fiction_Science Fiction_World Versions_Alternate and Parallel Worlds_Species Evolution_Anthropology/sociology,Hominids is the first book of The Neanderthal Parallax_ a trilogy that will examine two unique species of people. They are alien to each other_ yet alike in their never-ending quest for knowledge and essential humanity. We are one of those species_ the other is the Neanderthals of a parallel world where they_ not Homo sapiens_ became the dominant intelligence. In that world_ Neanderthal civilization has reached heights of culture and science comparable to our own_ but with a radically different history_ society_ and philosophy.

""The redline of a laser gunsight split the darkness and targeted the wall next to his head. There was a muffled sound like a dry cough and a bullet thudded into the wall above him. He slid forward under the bed...."" Graham Greene's classic spy tale ""A Branch of the Service"" leaves the heart pounding and nothing to the imagination. On the run during a fictional mole hunt of the mid-eighties_ Greene's spy faces an uncertain fate at every turn. Indeed_ the dashing spy on the run is one of the great icons of twentieth-century fiction_ reflecting the shifting currents of national and international politics for a century and more.

The Oxford Book of Spy Stories offers a panorama of the best spy stories which have forever fixed the concept of espionage in the popular imagination. In twenty-nine tales of political intrigue_ wartime heroism_ and peacetime scheming_ we see the spy at work and at rest_ sometimes the romantic savior of a nation's secret_ more often an embittered loner_ wracked with disillusion and uncertainty. The stories--by such famous authors as Ambrose Bierce_ W. Somerset Maugham_ Frank O'Connor_ Ian Fleming_ Len Deighton_ Graham Greene_ and Edward D. Hoch--range from traditional thrillers with the spy as hero to explorations of the metaphoric potential of espionage and the moral_ political_ and psychological issues that such an activity brings into question. Together with Michael Cox's fascinating introduction_ they form a wonderfully entertaining literary insight into a world of intrigue and deception.

Bridges with Spirit,Fiction_Nonfiction (admin Use Only),Adam Voith's first book uses a combination of both fictional and non-fictional writing in the form of essays_ short stories_ borderline poems and scripts. The book opens at a Beatles concert in Pennsylvania in 1960-something and ends with a cross-country trip to the optimism of the second gold rush in California. Whether traveling in search of tiny rock shows and rare records_ attending his best friend's funeral_ skipping classes_ getting dumped by his girlfriend_ or hanging out with imaginary superhero friends_ each section builds on the others to move half-fact_ half-fiction characters through the memory of the author via Mickey Lawrence_ the book's narrator.

"Stand up, Ernie Baxter: You're Dead",Fiction_General Fiction,"""My name is Ernie Baxter_ and my hands are tied. My history has passed to the memories and stories of my mother and ex-girlfriend. Bosses and co-workers. Bartenders and insurance agents. Friends and gym teachers."" 
The body of Ernie Baxter was just buried in the frozen earth of an Indiana winter_ but Ernies story is far from over. From beyond the pale_ this newcomer to the heavenly scene observes the folks left down below  notably_ his mother and onetime girlfriend Kyra  grieving his unexpected death. Kyras husband Dain_ a phony redneck with a trust-fund and a snowplow_ wonders what the fuss is about. 

At the request of Ernies mother_ the reluctant Kyra  pregnant and at the peak of a mismatched marriage gone wrong  is charged with the dubious task of searching Ernies laptop computer for any information a mourning mother might want to keep. Inside that machine_ Kyra discovers the private notes of an underground comedian named Ernie Baxter: bitter_ detached_ and seemingly unafraid of anything resembling the truth.

But no one had said anything about comedy_ not even at the funeral. In her search for the real story behind the missing years Ernie spent away on the west coast_ Kyra wades through stories of fast food for religion_ rock and roll clichés_ self-inflicted wounds for video game failures and all the while_ four people on a stage somewhere in Seattle try desperately not to piss themselves. 

""You do things_ say things_ in hopes that you will remain intact_ removed from speculation and locked safely away in memories_ but its not to be. Memory_ in fact_ might be the greatest liar of all time. The most deceptive of sinners. The real face of death."""

Because the universe was vast and they had been out beyond the Galactic Lens. Because time is infinite and they had slipped beyond their own epoch. Because in whatever universe they were in they could raise no etheric word_ no telepathic beacon_ no other star vessel.

But for John Grimes_ a veritable Commodore Hornblower of the future space seas_ there had to be a way back. The first step was to locate Earth_ the launching place for all humanity.

But Earth turned out to be legend and myth and faith - and Grimes' rebellious crew were to enact roles already fabled before they were all born."
Star Courier,Fiction_Science Fiction_Adventure_Space Opera_A. Bertram  Chandler,"In his long and fabulous career as the Captain Hornblower of space_ John Grimes was to experience many strange things_ rising through the ranks of the Interstellar Federation from triumphs to disaster_ and ultimately becoming the most famous of the Rim Runners_ far out along the edge of the Milky Way.

But there was a period when Grimes fell between one cosmic empire and another_ on his own_ commander of only a single deep-space pinnace and looking for work.

And that was when he became a god! He thought he was just doing a mailman's job_ but the price of the postage turned out to be divinity - with a lovely nude postmistress certified for a goddess!"
The Broken Cycle,Fiction_Science Fiction_Adventure_Militaristic_New Frontiers,"Being lost in space was no new experience to John Grimes_ whose career as an interstellar officer had brought him into many such dilemmas. But being lost inside a colossal alien spacecraft had no precedent.

Complicating the matter was the discovery that the very universe was not their own but an alternate and that their captor seemed to be the omnipotent force of that entire other cosmos.

As Grimes' only companion was the comely policewoman_ Una Freeman_ the fate that the Alien God selected for them required the creation of a Garden of Eden. But there were two serpents in this one - both of them bicycles!"
Alternate Orbits,Fiction_Science Fiction_Adventure_Soldiers Of Fortune_A. Bertram  Chandler,"""When Kinsolving's Planet crosses your path_ beware!""

Commodore John Grimes would have done well to heed this warning. But the evil magic of Kinsolving draws him on_ pulling him on a journey through the universes. Is Grimes a swiftly fading literary ghost_ doomed to disappearance for the inadvertent theft of a meerschaum pipe? Or_ is he a flesh and blood Commodore_ sailing the spaceways from world to world_ enjoying dangerous voyages to momentary safe ports?

It does not matter what role is the ""true John Grimes"" for none can protect him from the grasp of Kinsolving's Planet_ an abandoned colony which reaches out for man_ for the target_ John Grimes_ who is inexorably sucked toward his final destiny..."
The Dark Dimensions,Fiction_Science Fiction_Adventure_Soldiers Of Fortune_A. Bertram  Chandler,"Commodore John Grimes was finally getting his space wings back. On his old ship_ Faraway Quest_ Grimes was to venture forth to the very Rim of the known worlds_ seeking... The Outsider.

""The Outsiders' Ship... is a storehouse of science and technology... we_ and the Federation_ and the Shaara Empire_ and probably quite a few more_ have sent expeditions. Everyone of them has ended disastrously.""

So_ it is out to the Rim and find The Outsider. But the mystery ship is not always easy to find. And other worlds_ too_ yearn for the treasure of the alien technology. What Commodore Grimes finds at the Rim_ and what finds him there_ sends him racing through time tracks_ surrounded by enemies and temporary friends_ trying endlessly to discover the secret and dangers of... The Outsider"
The Amazing Dr. Darwin,Fiction_Fantasy_Historical_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives,"18th Century Europe: It is an age when superstition is beginning to give way to the force of human reason_ and no man so fully embodies the spirit of the times as Dr. Erasmus Darwin.  Thinker_ healer_ and explorer of the bizarre and the seemingly supernatural_ no mystery can stand for long against Darwin's enlightened analysis.  And there are far more mysteries than history knows...

For Erasmus Darwin's world is filled with oddities that most cannot believe: from unknown beings lurking just outside the boundaries of civilization_ to anomalies that even the greatest natural philosophers will be hard-pressed to explain_ to mysterious deaths that give rise to fears of malevolent sorcery.

And when the renowned Dr. Darwin is called upon to heal a man dying of an ailment that seems impossible_ he has no idea that it is the beginning of a quest that will lead him to the darkest corners of Europe_ and a stunning encounter with the most famous inhabitant of a certain Scottish loch...

The Mageworlds would never threaten the Republic again.

A broken and drifting ship_ its long-dead captain still strapped in the command seat: thats what free-spacers call a starpilots grave. When one of these derelict craft appears in the net_ the artificial barrier zone separating the Republic from the Mageworlds_ the discovery is no accident. Its a sign_ a warning that the Mageworlds have not forgotten the Republic  and the Magelords make long plans.

But the Magelords werent planning on Beka Rosselin-Metadi.

Beka has unfinished business to take care of_ and his name is Ebenra DCaer: the man who arranged her mothers murder. DCaer is safe  he thinks  hidden amoung the Mages on the far side of the Net. Flying under a false name and false colors_ beka penetrates the Magezone and finds more than anyone expected: the Magelords have discovered a fatal weakness in the Republics defenses_ and are poised to wreak their vengeance on the hated enemy.

Her enemies are far too many to count_ her friends too few to make a difference. She can trust no execpt herself_ her crew  and the family she ran away from years before.

Beka has resources few suspect: a hidden base_ a long-forgotten oath_ and a dead mans legacy. But she has problems as well; for in a universe gone mad neither friends nor enemies are all that they may seem.

A play that began in treachery and blood five hundred years before has reached its final act. A broken galaxy will be sundered forever_ or else made whole."

And so far_ his use of them had been beneficial to the kingdom. But how long could he continue_ before the powers he had gained turned upon him_ to strike him with the horror of madness?

Athaya Trelane was not thinking of that_ however_ as she sat in the dingy tavern. Her thoughts were of herself. For already the first signs of the dread powers were manifesting in her! They were a gift that could not be denied - nor could the awful price!"

Lincoln,Fiction_Historical_North America_Nineteenth Century,Lincoln is the cornerstone of Gore Vidal's fictional American Chronicles_ which includes Burr_ 1876_ Washington_ D.C._ Empire_ and Hollywood. It opens early on a frozen winter morning in 1861_ when President-elect Abraham Lincoln slips into Washington_ flanked by two bodyguards. The future president is in disguise_ for there is talk of a plot to murder him. During the next four years there will be numerous plots to murder this man who has sworn to unite a disintegrating nation. Isolated in a ramshackle White House in the center of a proslavery city_ Lincoln presides over a fragmenting government as Lee's armies beat at the gates.

The cast of characters is almost Dickensian: politicians_ generals_ White House aides_ newspapermen_ Northern and Southern conspirators_ amiably evil bankers_ and a wife slowly going mad. Vidal's portrait of the president is at once intimate and monumental_ stark and complex_ drawn with the wit_ grace_ and authority of one of the great historical novelists.
1876,Fiction_Historical_North America_Nineteenth Century,1876 chronicles the political scandals and dark intrigues that rocked the United States in its centennial year. Charles Schermerhorn Schuyler_ Aaron Burr's unacknowledged son_ returns to a flamboyant America after his long_ self-imposed European exile.

Powers That Be,Fiction_Science Fiction_Planets & Societies,Major Yanaba Maddock wasn't much good to the company anymore. With lungs practically destroyed by poison gas in a military debacle_ she could barely breathe without coughing_ much less do anything the least bit strenuous. But it wasn't the company's way to discard those they might still find some use for...and so they retired Yana to the icy planet Petaybee to do their spying. Strange things were happening on Petaybee_ it seemed. Unauthorized genetically engineered species had been spotted. Geologic survey teams sent to locate newly detected mineral deposits were either coming up empty - or disappearing altogether. And the locals weren't talking. In fact_ the company had reason to believe that the locals were deliberately hiding something - and perhaps even plotting rebellion. As a combat veteran and a medical retiree due to spend the rest of her days on this arctic world_ Yana was the ideal person to get close to the natives. Having already lost her lungs in service to the company_ Yana wasn't much of a mind to freeze to death for it_ as well. But she quickly learned that the people of Petaybee were more than willing to adopt a sickly newcomer: they were eager to show her the ropes_ introduce her around_ teach her how to cook and how to keep warm_ and even dose her up on a home remedy that calmed her cough and soothed her ragged lungs like nothing in the company's state-of-the-art medical kits. As Yana's strength and health returned_ she became more and more determined to protect her new home and her new people from the depredations of a greedy and increasingly desperate company. For something strange and wonderful truly was happening on Petaybee. Something worth fighting for_ or even dying for - but_ especially_ something worth living for...
Power Lines,Fiction_Science Fiction_Alien Beings,"Yanaba Maddock's short-lived career as a company spy had ended the moment the planet Petaybee and its people had adopted her as one of their own. Now she was dedicated to keeping Intergal from exploiting and woundingor even killingthe world she had come to love. For Intergal persisted in denying that Petaybee was sentient_ and nothing would stop it from stripping the ore-rich planetsentient or not. 
Only solid evidence would convince the company to leave the planet alone_ and for all its sentience_ Petaybee's communications were highly subjective; indeed_ some outsiders seemed entirely immune to its voice. So Yana and her friends would have to find some other way to prove that the planet was worth more to the company alive than dead..."
Power Play,Fiction_Science Fiction_Alien Beings,Petaybee was growing up. Day by day_ the sentient planet - like any child - was learning to recognize and understand the meaning of outside stimuli_ to respond to those stimuli_ to communicate its own needs and desires ... even to use human speech. But few outsiders truly cared for the feelings and intelligence of what they perceived to be a giant hunk of rock - or a mere oddity to be gawked at. Some came to worship the newly awakened soul. Some came by invitation_ but without comprehension_ to harvest the almost magically curative native plants. Big game hunters came chasing rumors of fantastical creatures that simply gave themselves up for the killing. And tourists came in droves_ many of them searching for long-lost relatives among those whom Intergal had relocated to Petaybee during its colonization phase. The Petaybeans had their hands full trying to protect their beloved planet from the sudden influx of visitors. Then some of Petaybee's staunchest champions - Yanaba Maddock_ Marmion de Revers Algemeine_ Bunny Rourke_ and Diego Metaxos - were kidnapped. The perpetrators wanted Petaybee for its incredible mineral wealth. Their other attempts at plundering the planet had all failed_ and now they were determined to force the Petaybeans to make a trade: the planet for the people. They simply didn't understand that such a bargain was impossible. For the only one who could speak for Petaybee was Petaybee itself and no one knew what a living planet could do once it found its voice...
Pulling Through,Fiction_Science Fiction_Bleak Futures_Nuclear Holocaust/Post-Apocalypse,A gripping_ realistic account of a 'small' nuclear war and surviving its immediate aftermath_ told in an optimisttic_ ironic_ fact-filled yet non-pedantic way by a self-taught author and aerospace engineer_ Pulling Through is novella-length_ but interleaved within are references to useful_ cheap and expedient survival skills and technology_ which is documented in the appendicies. Ing's wry style first saw light in the 1950s in Analog_ and the return of this unique wordsmith after he raised a family and acuired his doctorate in communications is very welcome.
Drakas!,Fiction_Science Fiction_Shared Worlds_World Versions_Alternate Histories,"The Domination of the Draka begins as a British possession in Africa_ but soon becomes far more. Absorbing refugees after the American Revolution_ and later the Civil War_ the Draka become a people bred to rule with an iron fist. They permanently enslave the peoples of Africa_ when they do not simply kill them. 

But this does not slake the Draka thirst for power. Sweeping across the world_ the Draka empire engulfs nation after nation_ shackling into servitude all who are not Draka. Europe_ Asia_ and finally all the Earth and its colonies throughout the Solar System fall before the might of the Draka. 

But empires are not faceless monoliths; they are made of individuals_ complex humans with their own hopes and dreams. And so one might ask: Who are the Draka? What sort of people does the Domination rule? The Draka would have many different answers... 

...and this is their story.

The Birds,"Fiction_Horror_Animals Run Rampant, Werewolves_Daphne  du Maurier","The idea for this famous story came to her one day when she was walking across to Menabilly Barton farm from the house. She saw a farmer busily ploughing a field whilst above him the seagulls were diving and wheeling. She developed the idea about the birds becoming hostile and attacking him.
In her story_ the birds become hostile after a harsh winter with little food_ first the seagulls_ then birds of prey and finally even small birds_ all turn against mankind.
The nightmarish idea appealed to Hitchcock who turned it into the celebrated film. Daphne disliked the film and particularly disliked the translation of the setting from Cornwall_ with its small fields and stone hedges_ to small-town America.

Robert Morgand_ a Frenchman_ finds himself without employment and very little money in London_ England. He sees a poster for a tour that will visit the ""Three Archipelagos;"" that is the Azores_ Madeira and Canary Islands. The part that catches his eye is the need for an interpreter.

In the days that follow Morgand sees a poster for a competing tour that is going to accomplish the same goals_ only for less money. The two tours keep dropping prices until Morgand's tour company has to give up the fight. This leaves Morgand with no choice but to see if the winning company also required the services of an interpreter. It turns out that Thompson's agency does require an interpreter and he again finds himself with employment. The group of people that have signed on for the tour are an eclectic bunch; between their quirks_ the thriftiness of tour director Thompson and the almost un-seaworthiness of the ship Seamew_ Robert Morgand has his work cut out for him. Fortunately for him another Frenchman_ Roger de Sorgues is part of the tour and in the company of two attractive American ladies_ who unfortunately have also brought along their disagreeable brother-in-law. The charms of these American ladies_ one in particular (a rich widow) keep Morgand interested in doing his job.

About the Authors"
神の子どもたちはみな踊る (kami no kodomotachi-wa mina odoru),Fiction_Historical_Asia_General Fiction_Haruki  Murakami,"The six stories in Haruki Murakamis mesmerizing collection are set at the time of the catastrophic 1995 Kobe earthquake_ when Japan became brutally aware of the fragility of its daily existence. But the upheavals that afflict Murakamis characters are even deeper and more mysterious_ emanating from a place where the human meets the inhuman. 
An electronics salesman who has been abruptly deserted by his wife agrees to deliver an enigmatic packageand is rewarded with a glimpse of his true nature. A man who has been raised to view himself as the son of God pursues a stranger who may or may not be his human father. A mild-mannered collection agent receives a visit from a giant talking frog who enlists his help in saving Tokyo from destruction. As haunting as dreams_ as potent as oracles_ the stories in After the Quake are further proof that Murakami is one of the most visionary writers at work today."
Brief Interviews with Hideous Men: Stories,Fiction_General Fiction_Humor,"David Foster Wallace has made an art of taking readers into places no other writer even gets hear. In this new collection_ the author extends his range and craft in twenty-two stories that intertwine hilarity with an escalating disquiet to create almost unbearable tensions. These stories venture inside minds and landscapes that are at once recognizable and utterly strange: a boy paralyzed by fear atop a high diving board (""Forever Overhead"")_ a poet lounging contented beside his pool (""Death Is Not the End"")_ a young couple experiencing sexual uncertainties (""Adult World"")_ a depressed woman soliciting comfort from her threadbare support network (""The Depressed Person_"" chosen for Prize Stories 1999: The O. Henry Awards). The series of stories from which the book takes its title is a tour de force sequence of imagined interviews with men on the subject of their relations with women. These portraits of men at their most self-justifying_ loquacious_ and benighted explore poignantly and hilariously the agonies of sexual connection."
The BFG,Fiction_Children & Young Adult_Fantasy_Humorous Fiction,"When orphan Sophie is snatched from her bed by a Giant_ she fears that he's going to eat her. But although he carries her far away to Giant Country_ the Giant has no intention of harming her. As he explains_ in his unique way of talking_ ""I is the only nice and jumbly Giant in Giant Country! I is THE BIG FRIENDLY GIANT! I is the BFG."" The BFG tells Sophie how he mixes up dreams to blow through a trumpet into the rooms of sleeping children. But soon_ all the BFG's powers are put to the test as he and Sophie battle to stop the other Giants from tucking into the children of the world. The RAF and even the Queen become involved in the mission."
The Twits,Fiction_Children & Young Adult_Humorous Fiction,Mr. and Mrs. Twit hate almost everything_ including their trained monkeys_ the Muggle-Wumps. But now the Muggle-Wumps want revenge.
Switch Bitch,Fiction_General Fiction_Humor_Roald  Dahl,"These four stories are_ by turns_ funny_ bawdy_ touching_ and outrageous. They are for lovers of tales that combine the macabre and the erotic with intriguing twists of plot. 

In 'The Visitor' and 'Bitch' two extracts from the notorious diaries of Oswald Hendryks Cornelius are published. Hedonist extraordinaire_ Uncle Oswald knows how to turn an exploit into an extravaganza. 

The deliciousness of sexual expectation - and the dangerous potency of its effectsare explored in 'The Great Switcheroo' and 'The Last Act': here_ the power of desire is a double-edged sword.

Danny the Champion of the World,Fiction_Children & Young Adult_Family & Relationships,Dannys life seems perfect: his home is a gypsy caravan_ hes the youngest car mechanic around_ and his best friend is his dad_ who never runs out of wonderful stories to tell. And when Danny discovers his fathers secret_ hes off on the adventure of a lifetime. Heres Roald Dahls famous story about a 9-year-old boy_ his dad_ and a daring and hilarious pheasant-snatching expedition. Just as important_ its the story of the love between a boy and his father who_ in Dannys own words_ is the most marvelous and exciting father a boy ever had.
The Enormous Crocodile,Fiction_Children & Young Adult_Fantasy_Talking Animals_Humorous Fiction,The Enormous Crocodile decides that he wants a nice juicy child for lunch_ horrifying the other animals in the junglehis friend_ the Notsobig One; Humpy-Rumpy_ the hippopotamus; Trunky_ the elephant; Muggle-Wump_ the monkey; and the Roly-Poly Bird. Despite his secret plans and clever tricks_ what the boastful crocodile doesn't know is that the brave jungle animals have plans of their own for him!
Roald Dahl's Tales of the Unexpected,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Suspense_General Fiction_Humor_Horror_General_Roald  Dahl_Joe  Keenan,"A wine connoisseur with an infallible palate and a sinister taste in wagers.  A decrepit old man with a masterpiece tattooed on his back.  A voracious adventuress_ a gentle cuckold_ and a garden sculpture that becomes an instrument of sadistic vengeance.  Social climbers who climb a bit too quickly.  Philanderers whose deceptions are a trifle too ornate.  Impeccable servants whose bland masks slip for one vertiginous instant.
In these deliciously nasty stories an internationally acclaimed practitioner of the short narrative works his own brand of black magic: tantalizing_ amusing_ and sometimes terrifying readers into a new sense of what lurks beneath the ordinary.  Incuded in Roald Dahl's Tales of the Unexpected are such notorious gems of the bizarre as ""The Sound Machine_"" ""Lamb to the Slaughter_"" ""Neck_"" and ""The Landlady.""

Chimera,Mythology_Reinterpretations,John Barth injects his signature wit into the tales of Scheherezade of the Thousand and One Nights_ Perseus_ the slayer of Medusa_ and Bellerophon_ who tamed the winged horse Pegasus. In a book that the Washington Post called stylishly maned_ tragically songful_ and serpentinely elegant_ Barth retells these tales from varying perspectives_ examining the myths relationship to reality and their resonance with the contemporary world. A winner of the National Book Award_ this feisty_ witty_ sometimes bawdy book provoked Playboy to comment_ Theres every chance in the world that John Barth is a genius.
Giles Goat-Boy,"Fiction_Science Fiction_Humorous, Parody and Comedy_Technology_Cyberpunk and Virtual Reality",In this outrageously farcical adventure_ hero George Giles sets out to conquer the terrible Wescac computer system that threatens to destroy his community.
The Sot-Weed Factor,Fiction_General Fiction_Humor_Parody,Picaresque novel by John Barth_ originally published in 1960 and revised in 1967. A parody of the historical novel_ it is based on and takes its title from a satirical poem published in 1708 by Ebenezer Cooke_ who is the protagonist of Barth's work. The novel's black humor is derived from its purposeful misuse of conventional literary devices.
Sabbatical: A Romance,Fiction_General Fiction,"Subtitled ""a romance_"" Sabbatical is the story of Susan Rachel Allan Seckler_ a sharp young associate professor of early American literature - part Jewish_ part Gypsy_ and possibly descended from Edgar Allan Poe - and her husband Fenwick Scott Key Turner_ a 50-year-old ex-CIA officer currently between careers_ a direct descendant of the author of ""The Star Spangled Banner"" and himself the author of a troublemaking book about his former employer. Seven years into their marriage_ they decide to take a sabbatical_ a sailboat journey on which they sum up their years together and try to make important decisions about the years ahead. True to its subtitle_ the novel combines the mysterious and marvelous (unexplained disappearances; a fabled sea monster in Chesapeake Bay) with romantic love and daring adventure."
Lost in the Funhouse,Fiction_General Fiction,Barth's lively_ highly original collection of short pieces is a major landmark of experimental fiction. Though many of the stories gathered here were published separately_ there are several themes common to them all_ giving them new meaning in the context of this collection.
Coming Soon!!!: A Narrative,Fiction_General Fiction_Humor,In this novelistic romp that is by turns hilarious and brilliant_ John Barth spoofs his own place in the pantheon of contemporary fiction and the generation of writers who have followed his literary trailblazing. Coming Soon!!! is the tale of two writers: an older_ retiring novelist setting out to write his last work and a young_ aspiring writer of hypertext intent on toppling his master. In the heat of their rivalry_ the writers navigate_ and sometimes stumble over_ the cultural fault lines between print and electronic fiction_ mentor and mentee_ postmodernism and modernism.
Letters,Fiction_General Fiction_Literary Fiction/classics,"A landmark of postmodern American fiction_ Letters is (as the subtitle genially informs us) ""an old time epistolary novel by seven fictitious drolls & dreamers each of which imagines himself factual."" Seven characters (including the Author himself) exchange a novel's worth of letters during a 7-month period in 1969_ a time of revolution that recalls the U.S.'s first revolution in the 18th century--the heyday of the epistolary novel. Recapitulating American history as well as the plots of his first six novels_ Barth's seventh novel is a witty and profound exploration of the nature of revolution and renewal_ rebellion and reenactment_ at both the private and public levels. It is also an ingenious meditation on the genre of the novel itself_ recycling an older form to explore new directions_ new possibilities for the novel."
On with the Story: Stories,Fiction_General Fiction,"Using the venerable literary device of the bedtime story_ which links fictions as different as The Arabian Nights and Charlotte's Web_ John Barth ingeniously interweaves stories from an ongoing_ high-spirited but deadly serious nocturnal game of tale-telling by a more or less desperate loving couple vacationing at their ""last resort."" As Scheherazade spun out her bedtime stories to save her life_ the narrator of On with the Story spins out his to postpone The End_ and to explore en route - wittily_ mournfully_ tenderly - love in modern life and postmodern literature. As the narrative cycles through the lifescapes of his subjects' stories_ Barth affords a view both panoramic and microscopic of our own landscape. With eye and pen both sharp and beautiful he depicts love ranging from the obsessively puppy through the sophisticatedly fatigued_ the delusionally murderous_ even the quantum-physical_ to the superbly fulfilled."
Once Upon a Time,Fiction_General Fiction,"From master storyteller and National Book Award winner John Barth comes a bravura performance: a memoir wrapped in a novel and launched on a sea voyage. A cutter-rigged sloop sets sail for an end-of-season cruise down into the ""Chesapeake Triangle."" Our captain: a middle-aged writer of some repute. The sole crewmate: his lover_ friend_ editor_ and wife. The journey turns out to be not the modest three-day cruise it at first seems. As we sail through sun and storm_ our skipper spins (and is spun by) the Story of His Life - an operatic saga that's part Verdi_ part Puccini_ and more than a dollop of bouffe_ a compound narrative voyaging through the imagination. Crisscrossing the past_ mixing memory with desire_ our narrator navigates among the waypoints of his life_ beguiling us with tales of adventure and despair_ love and marriage_ selves and counterselves_ aging and sailing_ teaching and writing - steering always by the polestar of Vocation_ the storyteller's call."
The Last Voyage of Somebody the Sailor,Fiction_General Fiction_Literary Fiction/classics,National Book Award winner John Barth offers a rambunctious story full of narrative high jinks in this lively_ inventive epic. Journalist Simon Behler finds himself in the house of Sinbad the Sailor after being washed ashore during a seagoing adventure. Over the course of six evenings_ the two take turns recounting their voyages_ merging medieval Baghdad and twentieth-century Maryland in a brilliantly entertaining weave of stories within stories.
The Tidewater Tales,Fiction_General Fiction,"""Tell me a story!"" Katherine Shorter Sherritt Sagamore orders her husband Peter Sagamore  and so lets loose a flood of tales that floats them both past encounteres with their own lives and loves_ entanglements with the CIA and toxic waste_ and fantastically inventive brushes with some of the greatest characters of all time_ including updated versions of Don Quixote_ Odysseus_ and Scheherazade."
The Floating Opera,Fiction_General Fiction,"Barth's first novel_ after two unfinished failures that he describes elsewhere in his nonfiction. Opera_ while a tidy little exercise in experimental '60s nihilism_ would probably not have launched a successful career were it not nominated for the National Book Award.

While brimming with the kind of mental energy that filled his later books_ The Floating Opera shares little of the fascination with mythology and story-craft that his best fiction does. Much of the book seems dated today  particularly one chapter where Barth makes experimental use of double columns in the text layout.

Amazingly_ Barth's editor called the original ending of the book ""too dark"" and made him change it as a condition of publication. The revised edition (published 1967) put Barth's original ending back.

In The Ascent of Wonder_ David G. Hartwell_ editor of the critically acclaimed_ World Fantasy Award-winning The Dark Descent: The Evolution of Horror_ which redefined the literature of terror_ joines with noted anthologist Kathryn Cramer to craft an equally ambitious exploration of this challenging and controversial literary form.  The volume contains more than sixty exciting_ insightful works of short science fiction by many of the field's best-known writers_ as well as insightful interpretive essays by the editors and by author and scientist Gregory Benford.

The Ascent of Wonder is not only a definitive collection of many of science fiction's landmark works_ it also provides a brilliant critical analysis of the origins and meaning of this popular literary form.  ""Hard SF is about the beauty of truth_"" writes David Hartwell in his Introduction.  ""It is a symbolic representation of the wonder at the perception of truth that is experienced at the moment of scientific discovery.""  The stories in the collection explore that theme -- the lively dialogue between unbridled imagination and hard scientific reality that has produced the field's most influential and memorable works.  The authors represented range from the genre's earliest pioneers to its most visionary innovators_ and its most outstanding younger talents.
Includes introductions by Gregory Benford_ Kathryn Cramer_ and David G. Hartwell."

And they promised never to fight in an unjust cause or to fight for personal gain.  All the knights of the Round Table took this oath.
The first book John Steinbeck read as a child was the Caxton Mortre d' Arthur and he considered it one of the most challenging tasks of his career to modernize the stories of King Arthur.  ""These stories are alive even in those of us who have not read them.   And_ in our day_ we are perhaps impatient with the old words and the stately rhythms of Malory.

For instance_ what if a person were cloned in pairs_ one male_ and one female. Raised together_ a self-contained unit_ one providing the other's every need -- friendship_ trust_ love_ sex_ a fully functional human pair with absolutely no insecurities or complexes. What if one of the pair died?
Le Guin explores this scenario in ""Nine Lives."" Though we know much more about cloning than we did 30 years ago_ there are still psychological questions about human cloning that remain unanswered_ and perhaps always will.
On a Far Out mission to mine the resources of a distant planet_ two friends and co-workers_ Pugh and Martin_ just average working men with faults_ receive a worker contingent of brilliant_ efficient look-alike clones_ five men and five women. The clones are totally reliant upon themselves and one another. They inadvertently exclude the two miners_ who begin to feel resentful. What follows is an interesting exposition on the strengths of such a group... and the weaknesses.

Her hair was ""lovely as dawn_"" and she was ""gorgeous as the sunset.""  Her breath carried a sweet and enticing fragrance of exotic flowers that amazed all who sensed even the slightest trace of it.  Alexander's physician realized however_ that the woman had been fed minute amounts of poison from birth_ to the extent that now her slightest kiss was death to all who experienced its deadly delight.

Hawthorne's Rappaccini is a man of science_ so cold and so calculating_ that he has absolutely no moral regrets or compunctions if sacrificing them means even the minutest advancement of his vast knowledge.  He has a beautiful daughter_ and a young man_ Giovanni_ has fallen deeply in love with her.  What follows is a tragic tale of love amidst the dark whorls of Gothic horror written in Hawthorne's singular literary style.

A writer of striking originality_ he spoke with a highly individual yet ordered voice in which lucidity and intensity combine to a remarkable degree. His love poetry_ some of his best-known and most distinctive work_ is at once cynical and passionate_ romantic and erotic_ personal and universal. He wanted his poetry to act as a ""spiritual cathartic"" to the poet and the reader. His work has been described as ""romanticism boiled dry_"" a striving for the pure_ the unpretentious_ the essential_ the vigorous_ and the ""non-literary.""

This volume represents Graves' final thoughts on his prodigious body of work_ containing those poems which he most wanted to see survive. Long out of print_ it is being reissued to honor his death in early 1986."

Unusual Suspects,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Julie  Smith_John  Lutz_David  Corn_James  Grady,"In Unusual Suspects_ America's most acclaimed crime writers_ along with some authors rarely associated with the genre_ contribute fifteen new stories and two rediscovered classics to this riveting anthology.

James Lee Burke_ author of the bestselling Dave Robicheaux mysteries_ gives us a feverishly atmospheric tale of racism and moral courage on the Louisiana bayou. From the files of Jim Thompson_ the godfather of American noir_ comes the story of a murder with a victim so nasty we defy anyone to shed a tear far him. And Joyce Carol Oates shows us how a sudden brush with violence can turn a public servant into a public enemy. The result is a deliriously pulse-pounding collection that proves that although crime doesn't pay_ it can help a good cause.

All the stories in this collection of crime fiction have been donated to benefit Share Our Strength_ a Washington_ D. C.-based nonprofit organization that combats hunger_ poverty_ and illiteracy.

Kisses of Death: A Nathan Heller Casebook,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Max Allan  Collins,"The private eye is as American as mom_ apple pie  and gangsters and bootlegging. A child of the Roaring Twenties and the Depression Thirties_ he is a genuine American hero with his poetic slang and his attempt to make things right as he goes down Mean Streets.

Max Allan Collins has recreated the great era of the P.I. in Nathan Heller. ""I wanted to do the traditional P.I._"" Collins writes in his introduction to Kisses of Death_ ""the tender tough guy in the trenchcoat and fedora with a bottle of wry in his bottom desk drawer. I didn't want to update him_ and I didn't want to plop him down in contemporary times like a drunk who fell off a time machine."" In novels and short stories_ Collins has traced Heller's changes_ and America's changes from the early thirties to the sixties_ and in doing so has received a record nine Private Eye Writers of America ""Shamus"" nominations for his the series_ winning twice. Each story investigates a genuine unsolved crime of the past.

Kisses of Death contains the previous unpublished title novella_ in which Heller becomes associated with Marilyn Monroe and solves the famous Bodenheim murders. In other stories_ he finds a solution to the death of actress Thelma Todd_ becomes associated with Eliot Ness_ and discovers who killed the midget that Bill Veeck had come to bat in a major league baseball game.

The book includes a new introduction and afterward by the author_ and a Max Allan Collins checklist.

For three fisherman who dare to brave the crossing to the other side_ it is a sign of the wrath of God they alone dare challenge.  The sea life upon which they make their living is abundant enough there to allow them comfortable lives -- if they survive each day.  But the Maelström will test them.

The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket and Related Tales,Fiction_Adventure_Military and Naval Adventure_General Fiction_Humor_Edgar Allan  Poe,"The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket is an archetypical American story of escape from home and family which traces a young man's rite of passage through a series of terrible brushes with death during a fateful sea voyage. Apart from its violence and mystery_ the tale calls attention to the act of writing and to the problem of representing truth. Pym -- his only novel -- has become the key text for our understanding of Poe.

This edition offers eight additional tales which are linked to Pym by their treatment of persistent themes and by their ironic commentary on Poe's mystification of his readers.

Everyone and everything seems out to destroy him -- the tour group of journalists that simply can't resist turning on him for his ""experiments"" with primates_ publishing so-called ""statements"" that he did not make_ discussing methods and procedures that they never witnessed.  His wife -- their familiarity breeding mutual contempt between them_ not to mention her constant cheating...  These are starting to drive him into ridiculous fantasies that are harder to separate from reality each time_ where he sees people and things that aren't there and where facets of his personality take on surprising forms.

All of us experience stress in varying degrees... truck drivers_ doctors_ janitors_ lawyers... scientists.  This story about the humanity of a scientist outside of his god-like profession is striking in its portrayal of the human condition.  Hard SF at its best."

Constable on the Hill,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives_General Fiction_Humor,"Nicholas Rhea's first problems upon his arrival as the village constable were the cabbages and wood pigeons hanging on his door knobs_ coupled with the doubtful skills of the removal men. None the less_ it didn't take him long to settle into a delightful part of North Yorkshire.

This book tells of Nicholas Rhea's first fascinating months as the village policeman of Aidensfield; it reveals the personality of the people he served. There was Aud George who informed the village of local deaths by using his own coded system_ the unknown farmer's lad who filled the bobby's empty petrol tank with fuel and then announced that it wasn't his to give away. Country sports are featured too -- there is the annual Coursing Meeting where Rhea has to deal with a demonstration against the sport_ there is the greyhound racing in the village field complete with bookies_ and the inevitable fox hunters whose trail led through the police house garden.

Dogs are a part of a policeman's life: here we meet dogs like Rufus with a penchant for dustbins_ Topsie the Yorkshire terrier for whom a donkey caused problems_ and Emperor the Alsatian who made a lavatory of Stumpy Sykes's flower beds. There are also the pony that could open gates and the lurcher that worried a budgerigar.

Constable in the Shrubbery,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives,"As the village constable of Aidensfield_ Nick has never taken part in a murder investigation. But murder finally comes as Lord Thackerston celebrates his birthday with a mansion full of family and guests. The TV series ""Heartbeat"" is based on the ""Constable"" series of novels."
Constable About the Parish,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives,"For centuries the parish church has been the focal point for many activities within a village and Aidensfield is no exception.
In this latest collection of tales from the North Yorkshire moorland community of Aidensfield_ now famous for its portrayal in Heartbeat_ we meet people from the pews; Catholics_ Anglicans and those from other faiths unite to cause work for the village constable.
PC Nick and Sergeant Blaketon find themselves perambulating the parish boundaries_ and the vicar upsets the villagers by charging everyone for repairs to the chancel - non-Christians and others besides. Then Nick discovers there's an ancient law which says it is hisduty to collect the money.
The vicar's wife appears to be having an affair with a Borstal trainee_ Claude Jermiah Greengrass brews some ale to celebrate a society wedding at which the chief constable is a guest_ a baby is abandoned outside the Catholic church and there are problems with a graveyard-mowing sheep who doesn't like to hear swear-words. Nick tries to prevent a family researcher from unearthing some unpalatable truths about an ancestor_ there's a mysterious death during a sword dance and_ when the vicar decides to hold a service for working animals_ Greengrass claims that Alfred is a guard dog."
Omens of Death,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives,"When Detective Inspector Montague Pluke noticed the solitary crow upon the roof of No. 15 Padgett Grove_ he realised it was an omen of death. An added factor was that the day was not the most providential of weekdays. Wednesday_ like Wednesday's child_ was often full of woe.

That unwelcome combination of portents dominated Montague's morning walk to the office and produced a mood of impending doom_ albeit with just a glimmer of excitement. This glimmer was based on the fact that_ as the officer in charge of the CID in Crickledale Sub-Divisional Police Station_ he had never solved a murder or never arrested a killer. In fact_ there had never been a murder in Crickledale_ a pretty limestone market town on the edge of the North York Moors. It was Montague Pluke's ambition to detect a noteworthy murder_ before retirement allowed him to seek neglected or forgotten horse troughs.

Fate seems to be on his side and_ the very next day_ the naked body of a young woman is found at the Druids' Circle. Then two more people die in suspicious circumstances and Montague Pluke is at last able to put all his police training_ as well as his great knowledge of superstitions ancient and modern_ to good work."
Constable at the Dam,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives,As work begins on the building of a reservoir in a valley near Aidensfield_ PC Nick becomes aware that it is having its effect.

Constable Over the Stile,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives_Police Procedural,In this collection of rustic tales_ Constable Nick continues his fascinating duties in the peace of Aidensfield_ deep in the North York Moors. There is a hint of unexpected wealth for Claude Jeremiah Greengrass when he finds a cache of silver coins and worries for Nick when a lad loses his doting grandad's silver whistle. When Claude Jeremiah's dog_ Alfred_ gets bitten by an adder_ Britain's most loveable rogue rings the local search and rescue team - and gets Sergeant Blaketon instead. But when a Girl Guide tumbles down a waterfall_ Nick has to organize a speedy rescue attempt. We encounter a frightened lady who hides in her garden shed and a wronged lady who wreaks vengeance upon an unfaithful husband while some menfolk use their own methods to deal with a thief who is stealing ladies' underwear.

Constable Over the Bridge,Fiction_General Fiction_Humor,Under the watchful eye of Constable Nick_ the villagers of Aidensfield continue their rustic lives deep in the North York Moors of the 1960s. Greengrass almost ruins Sergeant Craddock's accident-free statistics when a henhouse falls off his lorry while Nick copes with a couple of determined lady shoplifters_ a witness who can't remember what she saw_ a roadman whose daily sandwiches are stolen and a man with a penchant for searching dustbins to find old socks. An ancient Aidensfield custom is revived in a tug-of-war which spans the river with Greengrass as anchor man_ then Constable Nick performs some very special duties_ such as traffic control at the funeral of a donkey or searching for a couple of stone badgers who went for a midnight walk. Only a small portion of a village constable's work is associated with crime_ however: there were the villagers who helped a lady who had lost an heirloom; the tragic couple for whom everything went spectacularly wrong; and a surprise Royal visitor who poses a problem of secrecy for Constable Nick. It's all in this latest collection of tales from Aidensfield.
Constable Along the Highway,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives,There are changes in Aidensfield as Constable Nick continues his rural duties on the edge of the North York moors. With ex-Sergeant Blaketon occupying the village post office_ and a new sergeant in Ashfordly to keep the constables in order_ everyone must now adapt to a different regime.Tourism is booming on the moors but this brings problems_ such as an aged cyclist who always rides on the wrong side of the road_ caravan drivers who cannot cope with the Yorkshire hills_ motorists who run off the road for reasons they dare not reveal to their wives_ a delivery man who uses a lawnmower to tow his trailer and townies who don't know a cow from a bull.Meanwhile_ Claude Jeremiah Greengrass gets marooned on a roof when someone steals his ladder_ and Nick has to investigate some very inconvenient thefts while the Aidensfield oak tree planting ceremony is threatened by a dispute involving the age of two important ladies. And why would a householder lie about a burglar's visit?It's all part of the job for Constable Nick_ the man who inspired Heartbeat.
Constable Goes to Market,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives,For the villagers of Aidensfield and district_ the market towns provide a focus for their business activities as well as their social outings_ and Ashfordly is no exception. Normally quiet and peaceful_ it comes alive with traders and customers on market day - and such gatherings are never without problems for Constable Nick. As he goes about his rustic constabulary duties_ he sympathizes with members of the Thumbstick Club when someone steals their precious sticks_ copes with a wandering flock of geese on the village green and deals with near disaster when Greengrass's dog_ Alfred_ demolishes market stalls in his quest to catch a white rabbit and wonders how a live hand grenade came to be left among the potatoes. The area continues to reveal eccentric characters_ like old Mr Galbraith whose ambition is to freewheel as far as possible in his car_ or Twelve-pint Pete who can't resist the challenge of drinking a yard of ale in record time. Sightings of an Arab_ an American Indian_ a Laughing Cavalier_ a city gent and a UFO cause some puzzlement. There are linguistic misunderstandings_ people behaving with typical British stupidity and even a crime or two - it's all in a day's work for Constable Nick of Aidensfield_ the policeman who inspired Heartbeat.
Constable Along the River-bank,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives,Most police officers contemplate promotion_ and Constable Nick of Aidensfield is no exception. As he ponders leaving the village in a bid for higher rank_ his wife begins her new job but she doesn't want to leave their happy moorland home. Despite Nick's personal dilemma_ his rustic constabulary duties continue apace. There is drama when children go missing - 14-year-old Emily vanishes from home and_ in a separate incident_ young Craig plays truant from school - and there is more alarm when a man disappears in the river. Cars get stuck in the river too. Twin artists_ Prudence and Priscilla_ who share the painting of watercolours_ find their precious motor car in the river and it requires a hearse to rescue it while a newcomer thinks local elves have helped recover his car from the beck. Then when old Zachariah Isaac Pentecost (Zip for short) is taken ill_ Nick discovers he has a long-lost son_ but where is his son now? And what is the secret of the toy railway which is always set out in Zip's house? As ever_ Claude Jeremiah Greengrass causes problems_ not only with his illegal egg delivery service but also when his house key is stolen and when his bus driving leads to a mini-riot in the pub. And how does Nick persuade a Pyrenean mountain dog to vacate a chair? It's all part of the daily routine for Constable Nick of Aidensfield.
Constable in the Wilderness,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives,"The wild and rugged North York Moors remain one of the unexploited and least explored areas of England. In the depths of winter_ with dark days_ villages cut off by snowdrifts and animals marooned amongst the heather_ it has all the appearance of a true wilderness.For Constable Nick of Aidensfield_ however_ the fierce weather and wild terrain must not interfere with his police work. But the superintendent is not pleased when he catches Nick building a snowman in the midst of a blizzard and Nick faces more resistance when he considers evacuating a market town because a farmer on the moors reckons there'll be a devastating flood within hours. How can Nick convince the authorities the wise old farmer is right?Nick copes with Claude Jeremiah Greengrass almost killing himself on a runaway double bass_ ponders why an ageing widower would want a beauty contest in Aidensfield and wonders why a beautiful Spanish senorita has come to visit a confirmed bachelor farmer on the moors.There is crime too - a young boy's precious bicycle is stolen_ there is a cruel burglary in an elderly lady's home while a fake policeman is ""fining"" people for traffic offences. Nick is also faced with identical twins who commit clever crimes; there are ominous goings-on in a remote churchyard too and Nick has to cope with a spillage of mysterious liquid which threatens the water supply. It's all part of constabulary duties for Constable Nick of Aidensfield."

""The Hungry Guinea Pig"" follows in this tradition with an experiment in growth hormones run out of control.  Vainly_ the authorities attempt to stop the experiment_ and a final solution is left up to the creator of the monster to devise.  Just what would a giant guinea pig do when it escaped_ anyway?"
The Nuclear Age,Fiction_General Fiction,"The Nuclear Age is about one man's slightly insane attempt to come to terms with a dilemma that confronts us all -- a little thing called The Bomb. The year is 1995_ and William Cowling has finally found the courage to meet his fears head-on. Cowling's courage takes the form of a hole that he begins digging in his backyard in an effort to ""bury"" all thoughts of the apocalypse. Cowling's wife_ however_ is ready to leave him; his daughter has taken to calling him ""nutto""; and Cowling's own checkered past seems to be rising out of the crater taking shape on his lawn_ besieging him with flashbacks and memories of a life that's had more than its share of turmoil. Brilliantly interweaving his masterful storytelling powers with dark_ surreal humor and empathy for characters caught in circumstances beyond their control_ Tim O'Brien brings us his most entertaining novel to date. At once wildly comic and sneakily profound_ The Nuclear Age is also utterly unforgettable."
The Things They Carried,Fiction_Historical,They carried malaria tablets_ love-letters_ 28-pound mine-detectors_ dope_ illustrated Bibles_ each other.  And_ if they made it home alive_ they carried unrelenting images of a nightmarish war that history is only beginning to absorb.  Since its first publication_ The Things They Carried has become an unparalleled Vietnam testament_ a classic work of American literature_ and a profound study of men at war that illuminates the capacity_ and the limits_ of the human heart and soul.
Northern Lights,Fiction_General Fiction,Tim O'Brien's debut novel demonstrates the emotional complexity and enthralling narrative tension that later earned him the National Book Award.  At its core is the relationship between two brothers: one who went to Vietnam and one who stayed at home.  As the two brothers struggle against an unexpected blizzard in Minnesota's remote northern woods_ what they discover about themselves and each other will change both of them forever.

The Reluctant Detective and Other Stories,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives_Michael Z.  Lewin,"DETECTIVES AND MURDERERS
(Reluctant and Otherwise)

Michael Z. Lewin's view of the world is slightly offbeat. Reared in Indiana_ he created tales in which one of Indiana's most famous politicos_ ""Danny"" Quayle_ actually solves crimes. Having lived in England for some thirty years_ Lewin invented a ""reluctant detective"" who prefers to take advantage of Britain's tax laws than do any actual detecting. A few years ago_ Lewin invented a family of detectives  grandfather_ children_ and grandchildren  who investigate criminals in Bath_ England_ but (with the sensitivity of someone who sees a society as an adoptive son) Lewin gave the Lunghi family of sleuths an Italian background.

The 21 crime tales in The Reluctant Detective and Other Stories range from the Edgar-nominated title story_ to 2 investigations by ""Danny"" Quayle_ to the 6 cases of the Lunghi detective agency  and also include stories about Indiana police Lieutenant Leroy Powder (who is saddled with having to take a Japanese visitor on a night patrol)_ a hit man pretending to be interviewed by Dolly Parton_ a detective named Rover who happens to be a dog  literally.

Going After Cacciato,Fiction_Historical,"""To call Going After Cacciato a novel about war is like calling Moby Dick a novel about whales.""

So wrote The New York Times of Tim O'Brien's now classic novel of Vietnam. Winner of the 1979 National Book Award_ Going After Cacciato captures the peculiar blend of horror and hallucinatory comedy that marked this strangest of wars. Reality and fantasy merge in this fictional account of one private's sudden decision to lay down his rifle and begin a quixotic journey from the jungles of Indochina to the streets of Paris. Will Cacciato make it all the way? Or will he be yet another casualty of a conflict that seems to have no end? In its memorable evocation of men both fleeing and meeting the demands of battle_ Going After Cacciato stands as much more than just a great war novel. Ultimately it's about the forces of fear and heroism that do battle in the hearts of us all."
Tomcat in Love,Fiction_General Fiction_Humor,"A wildly funny_ brilliantly inventive novel about a man torn between two obsessions: the desperate need to win back his former wife and a craving to test his erotic charms on every woman he meets.

He is 6'6"" tall_ a cross between Ichabod Crane and Abe Lincoln. He is a professor of linguistics_ bewitched by language_ deluded about his ability to win the hearts of women with his erudition and physical appeal. He is Thomas H. Chippering_ a.k.a. Tomcat_ a masterly addition to the pantheon of unforgettable characters in American fiction.

And in his private dictionary of love_ three entries stand out.

Tampa. Just the word makes Tom Chippering's blood curdle. That's where his ex-wife_ the faithless Lorna Sue_ now lives with a suntanned tycoon whose name Chippering refuses to utter.

Revenge. If Chippering can't get Lorna Sue back_ at least he can wreak havoc with her new marriage. (How about some strategically placed lingerie in the tycoon's ""ostentatiously upscale Mercedes""?) He also has plans for Lorna Sue's brother_ Herbie_ with whom she has always had an unnaturally close relationship.

Love. His ex-wife may have disapproved_ but is Chippering's fondness for women--especially the nubile coeds who attend his classes--really so wrong? And now love finds a new form: Mrs. Robert Kooshof_ the attractive_ demanding_ and_ of course_ already married woman who may at last satisfy Chippering's longing for intimacy.

Tim O'Brien--acclaimed for his fiction about the Vietnam War--has now taken on the battle between the sexes with astonishing results. By turns hilarious_ outrageous_ romantic_ and deeply moving_ Tomcat in Love gives us a blundering_ modern-day Don Juan who embodies the desires and bewilderments of men everywhere."
?: Question Book,Fiction_General Fiction_Humor,"This book is filled with 169 off-the-wall questions such as:

If white wine goes with fish_ do white grapes go with sushi?

Do Roman paramedics refer to IVs as ""4's""?

Does distressed leather come from very tense cows?

and another 166 zany questions."
Period Revival,Fiction_Horror_Psychological Horror_General Fiction_Humor_Satire,Diary takes the form of a coma diary kept by one Misty Tracy Wilmot as her husband lies senseless in a hospital after a suicide attempt. Once she was an art student dreaming of creativity and freedom; now_ after marrying Peter at school and being brought back to once quaint_ now tourist-overrun Waytansea Island_ shes been reduced to the condition of a resort hotel maid. Peter_ it turns out_ has been hiding rooms in houses hes remodeled and scrawling vile messages all over the wallsan old habit of builders but dramatically overdone in Peters case. Angry homeowners are suing left and right_ and Mistys dreams of artistic greatness are in ashes. But then_ as if possessed by the spirit of Maura Kinkaid_ a fabled Waytansea artist of the nineteenth century_ Misty begins painting again_ compulsively. But can her newly discovered talent be part of a larger_ darker plan? Of course it can

They keep things running exactly they way they should be run_ and do not interfere directly in people's lives unless it interrupts traffic in some area.  A mob in Illinois_ made up of people tired of the absolute tyranny of the Board_ has gathered.  The Board has sent a fleet to determine the cause and solution of this new and interesting problem.

The only thing preventing mankind from seeing it must then be the immense distance of the body from Earth.  Therefore it is only a matter of some unknown time before its emanations finally reach Earth.

Scientists have finally managed to calculate exactly how far this body must be from Earth_ and at the start of ""Finis""_ it's due for its first appearance.

Yet Tip and Beau do not travel alone. Fortune has favored them with assistance from many strange allies_ including companions sworn to protect them as they move eastward to deliver their mysterious token to an even more mysterious end: Agron.

Beset on all sides by creatures of legend_ by treachery_ by the loss of loved ones_ and by cataclysmic ruin_ Tip and Beau and their allies - Elves_ Dwarves_ mages_ a pack of Silver Wolves and their mysterious leader_ Warrior maidens_ and Hidden Ones - struggle to keep the world from falling into darkness irredeemable.

The Plutonium Blonde,Fiction_Science Fiction,"I AM THE LAST FREE-LANCE PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR ON EARTH.

My name is Zachary Nixon Johnson. The year is 2057 and_ after a handful of species-altering upheavals_ Earth-shattering cataclysms_ history-changing extraterrestrial contacts_ and pop-culture disasters_ the world is now a pretty safe place But_ of course_ as in times past_ people still run the shades-of-gray gamut from good to evil. There are still cops and robbers_ saints and sinners_ voters and politicians. And ever once in a while some crazy thing happens that threatens all of society_ all of humanity_ even the entire space-time continuum.

And for some reason it always happens on my watch. So when B.B. Starr_ the ex-exotic dancer who is now the CEO of ExShell_ the largest corporation on the planet_ hires me for a particularly sensitive assignment_ I naturally excpect the worst. After all. B.B. Starr is one of the richest and most powerful people on Earth-why does she need me? But even with the Help of HARV-my annoyingly precise holographic assistant_ who's the most the most intelligent computer on Earth-implanted directly into my brain (don't ask)_ this assignment sounds like more than I can handle. For B.B. Starr wants me to locate and disable BB-2_ an android replica of B.B. herself. An android with a plutonium core_ 150 times stronger_ 176 times more durable_ 200 times faster_ with senses far more acute_ and vastly higher IQ than normal carbon-based humans. How can I hope to find and deactivate a bad-attitude_ hell-bent_ nuclear-powered_ super android that looks like an exotic dancer and might even be smarter than HARV?"
The Best of Fritz Leiber,Fiction_Science Fiction_Fritz  Leiber,"22 masterful tales by the sorcerer of science fiction! With an introduction by Poul 
Anderson.

Fritz Leiber has been spinning dark and delicate webs of fantasy since 1939_ when 
his first tales began appearing in the now defunct publication_ Unknown. Described 
as an actor_ author_ and world traveler_ Fritz Leiber is acknowledged as one of the 
all-time titans of the fantasy genre. Creator of the long-running Fafhrd and Grey 
Mouser swordsman series and such classic novels as Gather_ Darkness and Conjure 
Wife_ Mr. Leiber makes the world of science and the supernatural come alive in this 
mammoth volume. Some of the stories included are:

Wanted- An Enemy
What better way to unite the bickering peoples of Earth than to pit them against a 
common enemy! That was Mr. Whitlow's ingenious idea when he contacted the Martians. 
Looking like giant beetles_ the hideous creatures of the red planet would certainly 
terrify the world when they arrived on their mock invasion. But something went 
wrong! The aliens decided to make their ""play-war"" a real confrontation - to 
completely annihilate mankind. Mr. Whitlow's predicament grows when he locates 
another_ even more deadly enemy to confront the Martians.

The Night He Cried
In this marvelous SF parody of the hard-boiled detective story_ we encounter master 
sleuth Slickie Millane. His latest case begins when a heptapus visits him from 
Galactic Center in the guise of a shapely_ blonde human female - although she 
occasionally gets confused as to which tentacle should become what. Her unexpected 
arrival plunges Slickie into one of his toughest and most baffling capers.

The Big Trek
Come... join one of the strangest walking tours in the galaxy. Traverse a land 
unlike any other in the universe_ where strange creatures live among the ruins of their once advanced civilization_ where you can see the last traces of a race gone mad with greed and power. Everyone in the Milky Way is going to be there... why not you?

The Enchanted Forest
Elven was the last of the Wild Ones_ people who refused to obey the confining rules of civilization. Carrying the genetic materials to recreate his companions through cloning_ Elven landed his spaceship on an unknown jungle planet. There_ exploring the strange world for a suitable place to rebuild his society_ Elven discovered that even his broad standards of normality were taxed to the limit by the asteroid's remarkable inhabitants.

These and 18 other famous works such as the Award-winning Gonna Roll the Bones will send you soaring into the fabulous realms of ""Leiber"" imagination - a world where you can shoot craps with the devil_ make friends with electricity_ fall in love with a beautiful alien_ or visit a planet-wide madhouse. It's all here and much_ much more in The Best of Fritz Leiber."

When a new_ experimental hang glider is displayed at a small get together with some of the world's most dazzling socialites_ Kooning cannot help but assist a fellow socialite in the theft of the machine.  When it is crashed near the crowd_ the pilot is praised and lauded for his daring act.

At once an entertaining SF piece on the effects of rapidly proliferating technology and a discourse on the selfishness of young people who have everything but act as though they have nothing_ ""The Beautiful and the Sublime"" is a sublimely cutting piece on a society that is possessed of very little beauty.

What works would a lowly worker ant author?  What does the lofty emperor penguin have to say?  Le Guin's SF tale of animal communication taken to an extreme is a worthwhile piece for any fan of the genre.

Bennett O'Reilly is a chaos theorist studying monkey group behavior. They both work for the HiTek corporation_ strangers until a misdelivered package brings them together. It's a moment of synchronity -- if not serendipity -- which leads them into a chaotic system of their own_ complete with a million-dollar research grant_ caffe latte_ tattoos_ and a series of unlucky coincidences that leaves Bennett monkeyless_ fundless_ and nearly jobless. Sandra intercedes with a flock of sheep and an idea for a joint project. (After all_ what better animal to study both chaos theory and the herd mentality that so often characterizes human behavior?) But scientific discovery is rarely straightforward and never simple_ and Sandra and Bennett have to endure a series of setbacks_ heartbreaks_ dead ends_ and disasters before they find their ultimate answer...

Raised by intelligent_ language-using wolves_ brought back to human society at the court of Hawk Haven_ young Firekeeper has had to learn to cope with humans and their complexities... and discovers that_ for someone raised in a wolf pack_ the politics of a royal court are neither complex nor wholly unfamiliar.

How Hawk Haven and Bright Bay are unifying_ threatening the balance of power in neighboring lands. New intrigues abound. The former rulers of Bright Bay_ it appears_ were hoarding a collection of forbidden magical artifacts... which Queen Gustin took with her when she abdicated_ intending to use them to regain power. Melina Sheild_ a conniving_ power-hungry noblewoman_ is scheming to obtain them_ and she's older_ smarter_ and more devious than the Queen. And the ancient and even-more-devious civil service of neighboring New Kelvin would like to get their hands on those artifacts as well...

All of which will make life very hard for Firekeeper. Because the Powers of the World have decided whose job it is to obtain these much-contended-for magical articles: Hers."

Next to him_ a woman watches the sky_ as space capsules containing dead astronauts whirl around the earth in tight formation_ reminding them that space is cold_ indifferent_ and uncaring.

The sand is iron red_ soft and fine to the touch_ and omnipresent from the man's point of view.  It is in fact_ Martian sand_ and it has almost completely covered the entire Cape and the once proud spaceport there.   For him_ the sand holds secrets_ perhaps those which will bring new meaning to his empty life.

The capsules are distant_ moving points of cold light_ and omnipresent from the woman's point of view.  For her_ the capsules hold secrets_ perhaps those which will enlighten the past_ and bring new meaning to her empty life.

On his left_ Skinner slices the heads from rats after exposing them to shocks_ pressure_ and ice water_ in the hope that their glandular secretions will tell him something about stress.  On his right_ Sheila_ who's body screams desire at him every moment he sees her_ shaves the hair from guinea pigs in preparation for electrode placement.  Both sneer in contempt as he passes.

Further into the lab_ another researcher is driving electrode spikes into a dog's shaved skull.  A black Lab puppy_ its vocal cords cut out_ is dragging is denervated haunches along the wire mesh of the cage.  And distant is the sound of a truck_ bringing in a shipment of cats for experiments_ packed dozens to a cage.

But Tilman has a secret.  He loves his experimental ""subjects""_ feeds them_ cares for them_ speaks gently to them.  Unfortunately_ his supervisor is after results_ and so far Tilman has presented nothing of note.  What's wrong with being gentle?"

Stuart","James Blish was the first to make the cognitive leap necessary to one of the most enduring of science fiction's themes: that of mankind adapting to his environment not by changing the planet_ but by changing himself.


A seed ship has crash landed on a world made entirely of ocean except for a tiny triangular continent.  The men know that they will die_ but their mission is all-important -- to seed the planet with men who_ generations from then_ will rejoin the human race as a proud and independent people.

But the humans of this watery world in that long distant time will be human in name only_ for their spirits will be gigantic_ but their bodies -- microscopic.

Wilkin's Tooth,Fiction_Children & Young Adult_Fantasy,"From the publisher
OWN BACK LIMITED - it seemed like a marvellous scheme!  Frank and Jess had set up the business because they needed money - their pocket-money had been stopped just when Frank owed Buster Knell ten pence.  Their father had put a quick stop to ERRANDS RUN_ so why not try something that was bad instead?  Something like arranging for Buster Knell to fall down a man-hole and charging five pence... dreadful things that other people didn't dare to do?  So they pinned up the notice on the potting-shed - REVENGE ARRANGED_ PRICE ACCORDING TO TASK_ ALL DIFFICULT TASKS UNDERTAKEN_ TREASURE HUNTED_ ETC. 

The first customer to take the idea seriously was Buster Knell himself.  He said he'd let Frank off the 10p if Frank would help him get his revenge on Vernon Wilkins_ who'd knocked his tooth out - what Buster wanted was one of Wilkins' teeth in return.  That was a bit of a problem_ but luckily Vernon's small brother was just loosing a tooth... 

Then the two strange girls from the cheese-coloured house by the allotment wanted to get their own back on Biddy Iremonger_ who was rumoured to be a witch_ and who_ they said_ had put a spell on them.  Quickly_ news of the business spread and more children became entangled in the web of plots and mystery_ while Biddy Iremonger also felt she had a right to revenge herself - and perhaps she really was a witch?"
The Ogre Downstairs,Fiction_Children & Young Adult_Fantasy,"'Casper and Johnny pelted up to Gwinny's room regardless of noise.  Johnny thought she was on fire_ Casper thought she was being eaten away by acids.  They burst into the room and stood staring.  Gwinny did not seem to be there.  Her lamp was lit_ her bed empty_ her window shut_ and her dollshouse and all her other things arranged around as usual_ but they could not see Gwinny.  

'""She's gone_"" said Caspar_ helplessly.  

'""No_ I haven't_"" said Gwinny_ her voice quiverring rather.  ""I'm up here."" Gwinny appeared to be hanging from the ceiling.  She looked a bit like a puppet.  ""And I can't come down_"" she added.'  

She couldn't either.  At least not until the vol. pulv. splashed on her from Johnny's chemistry set had worn off.  The chemistry set had been a surprising present from the Ogre_ her stepfather.  They hated him_ and they hated his two sons_ Malcolm and Douglas_ just as much.  When they weren't wishing themselves dead_ they wished the Ogre and Malcolm and Douglas were.  

At any rate_ the chemistry set looked like being a distraction.  Especially when it proved to contain such curious chemicals.  They saw what vol. pulv. did to Gwinny_ and of course_ tried it out on themselves."

Well_ Luke saved him from that_ and started him on what seemed like a much more promising series of adventures - but he also managed to make life rather complicated.  Why_ for example_ was the gigantic gardener_ Mr. Chew_ so interested in Luke?  Why did his relations allow Mr. Wedding_ a total stranger_ to take him out for lunch?  And why did Luke keep insisting that on the day David had tried to curse his relations_ he'd actually spoken the words of an unlocking spell_ and released Luke from the chains that bound him? 

Sticking to his friend_ David finds he must help him - and the help that is needed is most unusual indeed."
Power of Three,Fiction_Children & Young Adult_Fantasy,"Though the Moor is enchantingly beautiful_ it holds great perils for the people who inhabit it.

The result is this delightful anthology of seventeen courtroom tales by top-notch mystery writers. Cats and mysteries go hand-in-hand_ no doubt. After all_ what other animal is as mysterious as the common-yet never ordinary-house cat? What lurks behind that smug expression? What hidden secrets belie that indifferent stare?

Always dignified_ cats are quick to deal out their own justice with a claw or bite_ and so it is only natural we find them in a variety of roles in these feline mysteries. Cats take the stand in their own defense to pounce on criminals_ provide evidence_ and turn the legal system on its collective ear- all in the name of justice. From a private eye who goes to bat for a cat's inheritance to a common mouser who turns out to be quite a bit more during a high-profile murder trial_ these tales of crimes are as crafty and cunning as kitties themselves-and just as entertaining!

For though their mental capacity is developed to a staggering degree_ these telepathic creatures have no concept of artificial devices.

The population at 20 billion_ the Housing Commission has decided that it would be best to reduce the legal living space from four square meters to three.  Forced out of his apartment by the landlord_ who has decided that his (illegal) four and a half square meter apartment deserves an extra half month's rent_ he buys a new cubicle space in a slummy section of town.

Then in a fit of exasperation_ he punches the wall_ knocking out a small section.  Behind it is a large_ empty_ forgotten room_ fifteen feet to a side.
