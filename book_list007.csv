Darknesses,Fiction_Science Fiction_Science Fantasy,"Corus is a world of humans_ but also of strange animals and supernatural creatures. It is a world of magical powers and of a few people who are Talented enough to use them. Alucius_ the hero of the story_ is one such person. In Legacies we saw how he grew from a Talented child on a lonely Nightsheep ranch in the Iron Valleys to a proficient soldier who used his wits and his Talent to become the first to escape military enslavement in the neighboring country of Madrien. Now captain of the Twenty-first Company_ the youngest officer of his rank in the Militia_ he must face new challenges_ both military and magical.

Corus has been fragmented since the collapse of its ancient magic-powered civilization. A would-be conqueror has somehow revived sorcerous creatures of legend to assist in his crusade to reunite the continent under his rule. The Iron Valleys are forced into an alliance with the Lord-Protector of Lanachrona and the Twenty-first is dispatched to stand against the invaders. Neither the officers above him nor the men under him know it_ but Alucius's Talent is their only hope for victory_ or even survival.

In Darknesses_ Alucius learns more about his magical Talent_ meets many more supernatural creatures_ and discovers the sinister forces vying for power behind the scenes across Corus.

The Fires of Paratime,"Fiction_Science Fiction_World Versions_Time Travel_Species Evolution_Longevity and Immortality_L.E.  Modesitt, Jr.","On the planet Query_ immortality is universal and the ability to time-dive -- to swim through the currents of time and history -- is common. Those whose talents are developed enough join the Temporal Guard. Formed millennia ago_ after the devastating war with the malevolent time-traveling Frost Giants_ the elite Guard serves Query as protectors and suppliers_ roaming the cosmos and time continuum to deal with races that might threaten Query and to bring back from technologically advanced civilizations the equipment they need_ for Query has lost all ability to create its own technology. In actuality_ the Guard acts_ as well_ as the rulers of the planet_ and their rule has stood unchallenged for thousands of years....

....Until Loki comes along. Even among the Guards_ Loki is something special. The grandson of the great Ragnorak_ Loki demonstrated extraordinary time-diving abilities even as a child. Now_ as an adult and a member of the Guard_ his powers are still growing. He can penetrate the past deeper than the legendary Odinthor; he can outperform his senior officers in speed and accuracy; he can dip millions of years through the undertime and kill an enemy with his bare hands. When there is a problem that other guards cannot handle_ they call on Loki. He has become almost a legend himself as a rescuer of lost time-divers and as the hero who single-handedly destroyed the sinister ""shark"" people. Mostly_ Loki would prefer to be left alone in the unglamorous Maintenance section_ where he studies the secrets of technology in the hope that someday Query might once again be free of the need to steal from other cultures.

But great men have powerful enemies_ and Loki's is the influential and unscrupulous Heimdall. Hating the undisciplined and independent-minded young time-diver_ Heimdall will stop at nothing to rid the Guard of Loki.... Drawn unwillingly into the web of intrigue woven by Heimdall_ Loki is forced to recognize the corruption and evil of a Temporal Guard that destroys entire civilizations with its time-manipulation and must steal from others in order to exist. He knows he must act -- an act that will require nothing less than becoming a god....",,,,,

Professor Hardy and Professor Grote disagree on the viability of Zeno's paradox.  Professor Grote believes that the frog will reach the top of the well.  Professor Hardy_ being apparantly ignorant of the idea of the sum of an infinite series_ firmly believes that it will not.  Who is right?  An experiment must be designed to prove the results once and for all_ but Professor Hardy has other ideas in mind.

The Dark Tower V: Wolves of the Calla,Fiction_Fantasy_Dark Fantasy_Western_Eccentric Variations,"Roland Deschain and his ka-tet are bearing southeast through the forests of Mid-World_ the almost timeless landscape that seems to stretch from the wreckage of civility that defined Roland's youth to the crimson chaos that seems the future's only promise. Readers of Stephen King's epic series know Roland well_ or as well as this enigmatic hero can be known. They also know the companions who have been drawn to his quest for the Dark Tower: Eddie Dean and his wife_ Susannah; Jake Chambers_ the boy who has come twice through the doorway of death into Roland's world; and Oy_ the Billy-Bumbler.

In this long-awaited fifth novel in the saga_ their path takes them to the outskirts of Calla Bryn Sturgis_ a tranquil valley community of farmers and ranchers on Mid-World's borderlands. Beyond the town_ the rocky ground rises toward the hulking darkness of Thunderclap_ the source of a terrible affliction that is slowly stealing the community's soul. One of the town's residents is Pere Callahan_ a ruined priest who_ like Susannah_ Eddie_ and Jake_ passed through one of the portals that lead both into and out of Roland's world.

As Father Callahan tells the ka-tet the astonishing story of what happened following his shamed departure from Maine in 1977_ his connection to the Dark Tower becomes clear_ as does the danger facing a single red rose in a vacant lot off Second Avenue in midtown Manhattan. For Calla Bryn Sturgis_ danger gathers in the east like a storm cloud. The Wolves of Thunderclap and their unspeakable depredation are coming. To resist them is to risk all_ but these are odds the gunslingers are used to_ and they can give the Calla-folken both courage and cunning. Their guns_ however_ will not be enough.",,,,,
Exile's Honor,Fiction_Fantasy_Sword and Sorcery,"Alberich had spent most of his youth in the Karsite military schools training to be an officer. At thirteen he had been chosen from among the male children of Karse by the most powerful priests_ the Voices of Vkandis Sunlord. Strong of body_ quick of mind_ but also lowborn --- and therefore grateful to the Voices for the opportunity he had been given --- he was the perfect candidate for officer training. And for Alberich there was no other place to go_ no way to get into a trade_ no hope for any but the most menial of jobs --- no way for the bastard son of a tavern whore to advance in Karse except in the army. Knowing this_ he had left his loving but impoverished mother_ never to see her again.

Alberich had risen in the ranks with almost unnatural speed. He had developed expertise in many weapons with an ease that was the envy of his classmates_ and picked up his lessons in academic subjects with what seemed to be little or no effort. But in fact_ the reclusive Alberich studied long and hard_ pushing himself ruthlessly. This lean_ tall_ hawk-faced young man got up before dawn for extra exercise_ spent all his spare time practicing against older boys_ and studied by the light of Vkandis' lamps in the Temple until the priests came in for midnight prayers.

In battle_ Alberich had an uncanny way of knowing what the enemy's next move would be_ and when and from where the attack would come. He had always had a sort of ""sixth sense"" about things which were about to happen. Instinctively_ he hid this ability with the utmost care_ for the Sunpriests kept careful watch for anyone exhibiting the ""demon powers"" which were the hallmark of Karse's greatest enemy --- the witch-nation of Valdemar. Those they caught were ""cleansed"" in the fires of Vkandis Sunlord.

Both Alberich's skill and secret served him well in the military_ and when his cavalry captain was killed during a skirmish with bandits at the border_ Alberich was honored by a Voice_ becoming one of the youngest captains in the army of Karse. And with this commission came a gift --- a handsome white stallion ""liberated from the enemy"" and reputedly bred by the barbaric Shin'a'in nomads. But both the commission and the horse came with burdens of their own. Alberich had been promoted ahead of two older and more seasoned officers. It did not matter that those two together hadn't been half as effective as Alberich had been alone --- those men would want revenge. And riding a white stallion_ no matter how powerful its gait and excellent its temperament_ made him feel as if he had a target on his back.

But these problems were merely distractions_ for the Voices had laid a trap which even Alberich's strange foresight could not predict....

Saved from burning as a witch when his odd white stallion braved the flames and carried him over the border into the witch-nation of Valdemar_ he was healed by the same enemies he had been taught to hate his entire life. Thought he knew he could never again return to his home_ Alberich also knew he could never truly become a Valdemaran. How could Alberich remain true to his own people and still retain his honor while training Karse's direst enemy?",,,,,

The Serpent's Shadow,Fiction_Fantasy_Fairy Tales_Historical_Paranormal Powers_Elemental Magic,"Maya Witherspoon had lived most of the fist twenty-five years of her life in her native India. As the daught of a prominent British physician and a Brahmin woman of the highest caste_ she had known only luxury. Trained by her father in the medical arts shince she was old enough to read_ she graduated from the University of Delhi as a Doctor of Medicine by the age of twenty-two. Welcomed into her father's lucurative practice_ she treated many of the wives and daughters of the British military personnel who made up a large percentage of their patients in the colonial India of 1909. 
But the science of medicine was not Maya's only heritage. For Maya's aristocratic mother Surya had not just defied her family_ friends and religion to marry Maya's father_ she had turned her back on their family's powerful magical traditions as well. For her mother was a soceress --- a former priestess of the mystical magics fueled by the powerful and fearsom pantheon of Indian gods. 

Though Maya felt the stirring of magic in her blood_ her mother had repeatedly refused to train her. ""I cannot"" she had said_ her eyes dark with distress whenever Maya asked ""yours is the magic of your father's bood_ not mine ..."" Surya had never had the chance to explain this enigmatic statement to her daughter_ before cholera claimed her life. Yet Maya suspected that something far more sinister than the virulent disease had overcome her powerful mother. 

But it was Maya's father's death shortly thereafter which confired her darkest suspecions. For her father was killed by the bite of a krait_ a tiny venomous snake. In the last hours of her mother's life_ in the seeming delirium of her final fever_ Surya had repeatedly warned Maya to beware ""the serpent's shadow."" With the sudden loss of her father_ Maya knew she must flee the land of her birth or face the same fate as her parents. 

In self-imposed exile in London_ Maya surrounded herself with every protection possible. All the magic Maya knew had been learned by covertly observing her mother_ and by cobbling bits knowledge together with the street-magic gleaned from a few genuine fakirs. Her workings were a mixture of instinct_ extrapolation_ and trial and error. Crode_ but somewhat effective_ her spells let Maya hide her household behind a wall of secrecy in a poorer section of the city. Here in a small but adequate house_ she lived with only the most loyal of her mother's servants and her mother's seven unusual ""pets"" --- if you could use such a word for creatures who seemed far more like friends.",,,,,

Not only is he a Master Mage_ but he is the head of a new community - the Vale of k-Valdemar_ located near Darian's home village of Errold's Grove - which houses a diplomatic council comprised of Hawkbrothers_ Valdemarans_ and representatives of the more peaceful barbarian clans of the north.

The Overlanders Bride,Fiction_Romance_Historical_Frontier And Western Romance,"Romance on the Overland Trail (Oregon Trail) would seem to most observers as non-existent. In fact_ it was a part of everyday life for the emigrants_ our ancestors. Along with the perils of travel in a small farm wagon for four to six months from Missouri to Oregon_ in The Overlanders Bride_ our hero and heroine face the dilemma of falling in love while dealing with the very real struggle for survival against hostile Indians_ frigid waters_ and becoming snowbound.

Daughter to an influential and charismatic man who owns the areas largest steamship business_ Polly is forced to run away from home after she is betrothed to a man that she does not love. Disguised as a gentleman so she can travel without being married_ Polly secures travel with a wagon train bound for the Oregon territory. Joshua Adams is trail captain and second cousin to Pollys fiancé_ a pious man built with a strong will of determination and sweat. Imagine Joshuas amusement when he learned that one of the men on his train is a woman. Nearly two weeks into the trail_ Joshua is convinced the only way to ensure Pollys safety and her return to his cousin_ is to marry her. In an ironic twist of fate_ Polly finds herself married to a man she does not love. The very thing she ran away from home to avoid_ she now faces. Follow Polly and Joshua through their adventures across the frontier as their marriage of convenience blossoms into romance on the Overland Trail.",,,,,

The subway under Boston had been growing in complexity for years.  It was so complex_ in fact_ that the best mathematicians could not calculate its connectivity.

The searchers would see a red light_ wait curiously_ and hear a train passing in the distance_ sometimes so close that it appeared to be just around the next bend.  Where was the train?

Двойник (Dvoynik) [The Double],Fiction_General Fiction_Literary Fiction/classics_Fyodor  Dostoevsky,"This early novel about a dual personality is a pioneer example of modern psychological fantasy. The theme of The Double has haunted many writers_ particularly in the present century when exploration of the ""other self"" which lives in all of us has become commonplace.

Dostoyevsky writes brilliantly in The Double (his second novel_ which he later revised and which he referred to as a ""confession"") of a civil servant_ Golyadkin_ who comes home from work after a particularly frustrating day to see another manhis doubleslipping into his room in front of him. With a mixture of anxiety_ liking and aversion_ he makes the acquaintance of his other self. The other self_ after entreating Golyadkin's friendship and learning his secrets_ turns ultimately into a formidable enemy.

""Here_ in embryo_"" says Mark Spilka in his illuminating introduction to the present edition_ ""is the new idea which Dostoyevsky brought to Russian fiction: the combination of inward and outward pressures to produce a split in being which is somehow real. It was an idea which went beyond the simple good-and-evil equations behind other doubles of the age.... In Dostoyevsky's own work_ it led directly to a host of doubles and divided selves.""",,,,,

Meanwhile_ back in Europe ...

The exquisite and resourceful Eliza_ Countess de la Zeur_ master of markets_ pawn and confidante of enemy kings_ onetime Turkish harem virgin_ is stripped of her immense personal fortune by France's most dashing privateer. Penniless and at risk from those who desire either her or her head (or both)_ she is caught up in a web of international intrigue_ even as she desperately seeks the return of her most precious possession -- her child.

While ...

Newton and Leibniz continue to propound their grand theories as their infamous rivalry intensifies_ stubborn alchemy does battle with the natural sciences_ nobles are beheaded_ dastardly plots are set in motion_ coins are newly minted (or not) in enemy strongholds_ father and sons reunite in faraway lands_ priests rise from the dead ... and Daniel Waterhouse seeks passage to the Massachusetts colony in hopes of escaping the madness into which his world has descended.",,,,,

Aging Puritan and Natural Philosopher_ confidant of the high and mighty and contemporary of the most brilliant minds of the age_ he has braved the merciless sea and an assault by the infamous pirate Blackbeard to help mend the rift between two adversarial geniuses at a princess's behest. But while much has changed outwardly_ the duplicity and danger that once drove Daniel to the American Colonies is still coin of the British realm.

No sooner has Daniel set foot on his homeland when he is embroiled in a dark conflict that has been raging in the shadows for decades. It is a secret war between the brilliant_ enigmatic Master of the Mint and closet alchemist Isaac Newton and his archnemesis_ the insidious counterfeiter Jack the Coiner_ a.k.a. Jack Shaftoe_ King of the Vagabonds. Hostilities are suddenly moving to a new and more volatile level_ as Half-Cocked Jack plots a daring assault on the Tower itself_ aiming for nothing less than the total corruption of Britain's newborn monetary system.

Unbeknownst to all_ it is love that set the Coiner on his traitorous course; the desperate need to protect the woman of his heart -- the remarkable Eliza_ Duchess of Arcachon-Qwghlm -- from those who would destroy her should he fail. Meanwhile_ Daniel Waterhouse and his Club of unlikely cronies comb city and country for clues to the identity of the blackguard who is attempting to blow up Natural Philosophers with Infernal Devices -- as political factions jockey for position while awaiting the impending death of the ailing queen; as the ""holy grail"" of alchemy_ the key to life eternal_ tantalizes and continues to elude Isaac Newton_ yet is closer than he ever imagined; as the greatest technological innovation in history slowly takes shape in Waterhouse's manufactory.

Such a Good Girl and Other Stories,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Suspense_Ed  Gorman,"Eleven stories from Shamus Award-winning crime novelist Ed Gorman that demonstrate both his range and his storytelling versatility.

The collection opens with ""All These Condemned_"" the story of two brothers and one shocking secret_ and ""A Girl Like You_"" an almost mystical story about a young man coming to grips with the meaning of love.  ""The Way It Used to Be"" features a small-town teenage bigot_ while a famous 1920s mobster is the lead in the somewhat whimsical ""The New Man.""  The chiller """"Judgement"" is about a Catholic priest_ and a very unlucky stick-up artist plies his trade in ""Ghosts.""

One of Gorman's favorite themes- lost love and its consequences- surfaces in ""That Day at Eagle's Point_"" and a tabloid TV news piece provides the basis for the shocking title story.

In ""Aftermath"" a woman struggles to recover after being raped by a policeman_ while the woman in ""Eye of the Beholder"" struggles with the effects of her own beauty.  The final story_ ""Angie_"" is a stunning_ Hitchcockian take on a small-town good-time girl who isn't quite what she seems.

999: New Stories of Horror and Suspense,Fiction_Horror_General_Ed  Gorman_Ed  Bryant_Ramsey  Campbell,"The weaving of fictional suspense and terror is as ancient as humankind itself. But where does this age-old tradition stand at the cusp of a new decade_ a new century_ a new millennium? This mammoth volume seeks to answer that question. You hold in your hands the state of the art -- of fear.
To prepare this groundbreaking anthology_ writer and editor Al Sarrantonio challenged a distinguished roster of authors to demonstrate with all-new stories the shape of horror/suspense literature as we enter the twenty-first century. As you will read the twenty-nine contributors responded by displaying the infinite variety which is the very hallmark of this field. Some of these stories will startle you or fill you with terror. Some will haunt you long after you finish reading them. There is even an eerily echoing chuckle or two found inside. But together_ these weirdest of tales join to form a great literary mosaic_ a vivid contemporary portrait of a genre which is proud_ potent_ and irresistible.
Not only is this the largest anthology of original horror/suspense fiction of all time -- not one story in 999 has ever been published before -- but it is also the finest. Here is a major publishing event with an attitude: to shake you up and scare you silly.

Famous Blue Raincoat,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Suspense_Ed  Gorman,"""Gorman is great; possibly one of THE greats_"" writes the British mystery journal Shots about Ed Gorman's short stories. ""If George Orwell had written thrillers_"" Shots continues_ ""he might have written them this way; never a word too many_ never a word too few_ never a word that doesn't come from the heart.""

Ed Gorman's mystery short stories have a flavor found nowhere else among contemporary writers. His tales have an amazing breadth of style and plotclassical detection_ private eye stories_ biter-bit tales in which criminous schemes turn back on the perpetrator_ and straight crime stories.

What they all have in common is a recognition that we cannot escape our past. The Judge Whitney-Sam McCain stories are filled with the sights and sounds of small-town America around 1958. ""The Closing Circle"" is both a detective story and a sensitive evocation of a girl coming of age. ""The Cage"" and ""Favor and the Princess"" are not only pure detection but also about understanding your first love years later.

You may like some of the protagonists_ such as private eye Jack Dwyer in ""Eye of the Beholder_"" and despise others_ including the narrator in ""Our Kind of Guy_"" but all of Ed Gorman's stories are filled with the truth of human experience.

Revenge of the Middle-Aged Woman,Fiction_General Fiction,Rose Lloyd was the last to suspect that Nathan_ her husband of over twenty years_ was having an affair_ and that he was planning to leave her.

Burks_Frederick  Marryat_  Unknown Author_Lafcadio  Hearn_  Homer_Giovanni  Verga_Prosper  Mérimée_Rudolf Erich  Raspe_Stratis  Myrivilis,Ostensibly a novel_ the story is closely based on the author's four-month sojourn with a group of South Sea Islanders_ the Typees_ after he and a companion deserted their whaling ship.  Initially the two Americans are charmed and fascinated by the exotic life of the Typees - their physical beauty_ the ragal bearing of their warriors_ the gracefulness of their women - and embrace with enthusiasm thir food and customs.  And yet the land of the Typees is not quite paradise: the two men are guests who may not leave_ and gradually they learn of customs of a more chilling nature_ making their escape from this tropical paradise a necessity.,,,,,
"White Jacket, or The World in a Man-of-War",Fiction_Adventure_Military and Naval Adventure,White Jacket...was understandably acclaimed for its authenticity when it was first published in 1850_ since Herman Melville drew on his own experiences serving on a U.S. Navy frigate in writing it.  (The book's celebrated depiction of the horrors of corporal punishment was widely credited with influencing COngress to prohibit flogging aboard Naval vessels.)  Yet while it is true that the book can be read as an involving account of life aboard the U.S.S. Neversink and the adventures that befall its officers and crew - the stalwart foretop captain Jack Chase, the poetic seaman Lemsford, the ferretlike quarter-gunner Quoin and the rest - there is something more here than a hearty tale of the sea.  For already there are clear signs - the mysterious_ perhaps cursed_ white jacket that gived the narrator his identity_ the elevation of the noble Jack Chase to an almost godlike status_ the subtle depiction of the ship's company as a self-contained universe - of the symbolism and powerful themes that would characterize Melville's greatest work.(book jacket),,,
Redburn,Fiction_Adventure_Military and Naval Adventure,"Melville's fourth book_ Redburn_ is a fictional narrative of a boy's first voyage_ based loosely on Melville's own first voyage to and from Liverpool in 1839.  Melville began the book under financial compulsion_ wrote it hurriedly_ disparaged it after completing it_ and apparently never realized how interesting a book he had written.  When he conceived it in a calculated attempt to regain the favor he had won in his first two books but seemed to be losing with his third_ he regarded it at worst as a step backwards to the earlier picaresque_ quasi-autobiographical level of Typee and Omoo and at best as an interruption of the progress toward greatness which he had made in his third book_ Mardi_ a metaphysical and political romance.  Yet he declared that he had ""spoken pretty much"" as he felt_ and the book contains a measure of intellectual and emotional substance unusual in works of its kind.(book jacket)",,,,,

The Marble Faun,Fiction_General Fiction,The fragility - and the durability - of human life and art dominate this story of American expatriates in Italy in the mid-nineteenth century. Befriended by Donatello_ a young Italian with the classical grace of the 'Marble Faun'_ Miriam_ Hilda_ and Kenyon find their pursuit of art taking a sinister turn as Miriam's unhappy past precipitates the present into tragedy.  Hawthorne's 'International Novel' dramatizes the confrontation of the Old World and the New and the uncertain relationship between the 'authentic' and the 'fake' in life as in art. The author's evocative descriptions of classic sites made The Marble Faun a favourite guidebook to Rome for Victorian tourists_ but his richly ambiguous symbolic romance is also the story of a murder_ and a parable of the Fall of Man. As the characters find their civilized existence disrupted by the awful consequences of impulse_ Hawthorne leads his readers to question the value of Art and Culture and addresses the great evolutionary debate which was beginning to shake Victorian society.,,,,,

April Morning,Fiction_Historical_North America_American Revolution,"On April 19_ 1775_ Adam Cooper_ aged 15_ signed the muster roll of the Lexington militia. This book by Howard Fast is the story of the next twenty-four hours in his life  the story of the birth of a man and a nation and a way of life.
It is a story of almost unbearable tension_ a deceptively quiet description of a single day in a boy's life_ of his moment of coming of age_ of the heroism of unheroic people_ and the courage that builds upon fear and hesitancy.
This is the story of a battle_ but we think it is unlike any battle story you have ever read. In all truth_ it is the story of the beginnings and the specific memory of America; it is for anyone and everyone who is an American or who has ever loved or cherished any part of what we call the American dream.
But with that the portrait here of Adam Cooper's coming of age_ of his first knowledge of love and death_ and of his struggle to triumph over his own youth is the most fulfilled writing of Howard Fast_ a stirring book of passion and hope_ as true an account of resistance and resolution as anyone has ever written.",,,,,
Seven Days in June,Fiction_Historical_North America_American Revolution,Howard Fast has long been one of the most vivid and passionate chroniclers of American history. Through such works as The Crossing and The Immigrants_ he has shown us the dreams and ambitions of the men and women who built a nation. Now_ in Bunker Hill_ he provides insight into both American and British points of view during the battle for control of Boston in June 1775  the outcome of which would dramatically influence the strategies of George Washington and Sir William Howe for the rest of the war. Most dramatic of all is the battle for Breeds and Bunker Hill: On one side_ a few hundred American men and boys_ fighting in the fashion they learned from the American Indians, on the other_ three thousand soldiers of the mightiest army on Earth. What follows is one of the bloodiest battles of the American Revolution. There_ for a moment in time_ the American rebels turned back Europes best-trained soldiers before they were forced to flee.,,,,
Spartacus,"Fiction_Adventure_Male-Action/Adventure_Historical_Ancient World (Greece, Rome, etc)","""Spartacus"" is a fictionalization of a slave revolt in Rome in 71 BC_ well known today because of the 1960 film version. It was originally published by Fast after being turned down by every mainstream publisher of the day because of Fast's blacklisting for his Communist Party sympathies. The story of Spartacus_ born a slave_ trained as a gladiator_ who led a slave revolt that was eventually put down by Crassus_ was immensely popular_ has sold millions of copies_ and has gone through nearly a hundred editions..",,,,,
The Last Frontier,Fiction_Western_Native Americans,Originally published in 1941_ The Last Frontier is the story of the Cheyenne Indians in the 1870s_ and their bitter struggle to flee from the Indian Territory in Oklahoma back to their home in Wyoming and Montana.

Fast extensively researched this book in the late 1930s_ visiting and speaking with Cheyenne experts in Norman_ Oklahoma. This was the first of Fast's many books to gain a wide popular audience, it was eventually made by John Ford into the classic film Cheyenne Autumn (1964).,,,,

Ιφιγενεια η εν Ταυροις [Iphigeneia he en Taurois],Drama and Plays_Ancient_Greek_Tragedy_Johann Wolfgang von  Goethe_  Euripides,"The modern reader may have difficulty conceiving of Iphigeneia in Tauris as tragedy_ for the term in our sense is associated with downfall_ death_ and disaster. But to the ancient Greeks_ the use of heroic legend_ the tragic diction and meters_ and the tragic actors would have defined it as pure tragedy_ the happy ending notwithstanding. While not one of his ""deep"" dramatic works_ the play is Euripidean in many respects_ above all in its recurrent theme of escape_ symbolized in the rescue of Iphigenia by Artemis_ to whom she was about to be sacrificed",,,,,
Ifigenia,Fiction_General Fiction,""". . . I didn't want to tell you the truth for anything in the world_ because it seemed very humiliating to me . . ."" The truth is that Iphigenia is bored and_ more than bored_ buried alive in her grandmother's house in Caracas_ Venezuela. After the excitement of being a beautiful_ unchaperoned young woman in Paris_ her father's death has sent her back to a forgotten homeland_ where rigid decorum governs. Two men--the married man she adores and the wealthy fiancé she abhors--offer her escape from her prison. Which of these impossible suitors will she choose? Iphigenia was first published in 1924 in Venezuela_ where it hit patriarchal society like a bomb. Teresa de la Parra was accused of undermining the morals of young women with this tale of a passionate woman who lacks the money to establish herself in the liberated_ bohemian society she craves.",,,,,
Memorias de Mamá Blanca,Fiction_Historical_South & Central America,"Mama Blanca's Memoirs recreates the lost world of later nineteenth-century plantation society. The ""memoirs"" tell the story of six little girls growing up on a sugar plantation outside Caracas under the ostensible patriarchy of their father and the madcap maternity of their beautiful young mother. In language at times comic_ often lyrically hypnotic_ de la Parra creates a series of vignettes and portraits_ embellishments on her own memories_ for a haunting portrayal of a particular culture and a distant time.",,,,,
Iphigénie,Drama and Plays,"Strongly influenced by Classical drama_ Jean Racine (1639-99) broke away from the grandiose theatricality of baroque drama to create works of intense psychological realism_ with characters manipulated by cruel and vengeful gods. ""Iphigenia"" depicts a princess' absolute submission to her father's will_ despite his determination to sacrifice her to gain divine favour before going to war.",,,,,

Sappho: A New Verse Translation,Poetry_Verse,Considered by the Greeks as their greatest lyric poet_ Sappho has long been the bane of translators.  Most of her poems are emotional and personal_ more in the form of colloquy than soliloquy: they are usually dialogues between Sappho and her friends_ forthright attacks on her enemies_ or exasperated exchanges with Aphrodite_ the omnipotent and pitiless goddess who was both her enemy and friend.  But Sappho also composed more impersonal songs for girls' choruses to sing at weddings or festivals in honor of Aphrodite.

Imagine_ then_ the excitement that Howard Carson_ an amateur archaeologist at best_ experienced when in crossing the perimeter of an abandoned excavation site he felt the ground give way beneath him and found himself at the bottom of a shaft_ which_ judging from the DO NOT DISTURB sign hanging from an archaic doorknob_ was clearly the entrance to a still-sealed burial chamber.Carson's incredible discoveries_ including the actual remains od two bodies_ one of them on a ceremonial bed facing an altar that appeared to be a means of communicating with the Gods and the other lying in a porcelain sarcophagus in the Inner Chamber_ permitted him to piece together the whole fabric of that extraordinary civilization.In David Macaulay's depictions of this dramatic discovery_ the fact that Carson's conclusions are wholly erroneous only adds to the wonderment of the find and the insights that we are given of that particular age.,,,,

No Reck'ning Made,Fiction_General Fiction,Raised in the poverty-stricken gulches of rural Colorado_ Clara Coleman forged her dreams from the certainty of school - a place that showed her a majesty_ order_ and gentility that had none of the empty anger she knew at home. Clara strove for this sense of stability and became a respected teacher_ principal_ wife_ and mother in Gold Flume_ a mining town near_ and not unlike_ the place of her childhood. It was there that she would spend her life reaching out to children whose hunger for order and justice mirrored her own. But when change came to Gold Flume it brought a new kind of people - men and women who didn't care about the mountains or the town_ who discounted decades of experience and compassion in lieu of what was current or fashionable. These people would change her life and threaten to take away_ in a sense_ all that she had accomplished.,,,,,

Le Premier Homme,Fiction_General Fiction_Literary Fiction/classics,"Published in France for the first time 34 years after it was discovered in the wreckage of the car in which Camus was killed--this autobiographical novel covers the years of Camus' childhood in Algeria_ growing up in poverty among silent_ illiterate women_ desperately searching for a father. Completely unedited_ the manuscript was transcribed by Camus' daughter Catherine.
The First Man is a radiant_ deeply moving novel of childhood. Camus intended it as the opening book of a projected epic - his War and Peace - but in its storytelling magic and its evocative power_ it has a satisfying completeness on its own_ covering_ as it does_ the years of Camus's childhood in Algeria. As he recaptures memories of growing up fatherless with a deaf-mute mother and an illiterate_ tyrannical grandmother_ Camus renders the poverty of a working-class neighborhood transcended by all the sensuous pleasures that nourish this boy's young life - the escapes to the beach and to the soccer fields with his schoolmates_ the joyous hunting expeditions in the backcountry with his uncle and his cronies_ the sounds and smells of the streets and docks of Belcourt_ the delights of the sun and the sea_ and his overwhelming love for his silent mother. Throughout there is the undercurrent of a frustrating search for a father and the awareness of the escalating tension between Algeria and France. But with the miraculous intervention of a wise schoolteacher_ the future suddenly opens up.",,,,,
La Mort heureuse,Fiction_General Fiction_Literary Fiction/classics,In his first novel_ A Happy Death_ written when he was in his early twenties and retrieved from his private papers following his death in I960_ Albert Camus laid the foundation for The Stranger_ focusing in both works on an Algerian clerk who kills a man in cold blood. But he also revealed himself to an extent that he never would in his later fiction. For if A Happy Death is the study of a rule-bound being shattering the fetters of his existence_ it is also a remarkably candid portrait of its author as a young man.As the novel follows the protagonist_ Patrice Mersault_ to his victim's house  and then_ fleeing_ in a journey that takes him through stages of exile_ hedonism_ privation_ and death -it gives us a glimpse into the imagination of one of the great writers of the twentieth century. For here is the young Camus himself_ in love with the sea and sun_ enraptured by women yet disdainful of romantic love_ and already formulating the philosophy of action and moral responsibility that would make him central to the thought of our time.(from the publisher),,,,,

She and Lewis have been corresponding_ but have never met until Joy comes to Britain for a visit.  Jack ordinarily feels rather uncomfortable around women; but nonetheless he and Joy become fast friends.

Murder Most Postal: Homicidal Tales That Deliver a Message,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Crime/Caper_Edgar Allan  Poe_Barry N.  Malzberg_John  Lutz_William F.  Nolan,"Ever since the first caveman sketched out the bison hunts on the wall of the Lascaux caves 16_000 years ago_ mankind has found a way to communicate. For centuries the letter was the primary form of communication across any distance. Kings_ popes_ lords_ heads of state_ scholars_ authors - all used pen and paper to plot against one another_ gossip_ woo and win each other's hearts_ and play intricate games of intrigue.

In the 21 stories in Murder Most Postal_ all by masters of the mystery genre_ the mail takes center stage. Edgar Allan Poe is here with his classic detective tale of a letter gone astray and the cunning way in which it is retrieved. Lawrence Block tells of the correspondence between a death-row inmate and the borther of the woman he killed_ and of the deadly consequences for both. Ellery Queen investigates puzzling philatelic theft. And Matt Costello writes of letters in cyberspace_ as a man pours out his heart to a stranger in a chat room in the last messages he will ever write.

Where There Is Nothing / The Unicorn from the Stars,Drama and Plays_Irish,"First published in 1903_ Where There Is Nothing was never reprinted in the author's lifetime.  It lost its place in collected editions of Yeats'a plays to a new version_ The Unicorn from the Stars_ in which Lady Gregory had a major share.  There has long been need for an edition of Where There Is Nothing to restore to general view an interesting play which_ unusually for Yeats_ has a modern setting_ a middle-class hero_ and a predominately naturalist technique.Yeats gave various reasons for abandoning the original play.  Perhaps one he did not mention was his doubt whether its open and direct style and modern Irish background might not identify the author too closely with the visionary central character_ Paul Ruttledge.  Many of Yeats's deepest preoccupations are reflected in Paul's pursuit of his apocalyptic vision: he abandons a life of burgeois comfort for hard freedom among the tinkers_ follows a religious life in a monastery_ and finally dies a martyr at the hands of a mob who cannot understand his ecstatic message: ""Where there is nothing_ there is God.""The drastically revised version_ The Unicorn from the Stars_ changes the period and social milieu and introduces new characters and plot complications which bear the marks of Lady Gregory's distinctive style.  Both plays are included in this volume to allow comparison of the plays themselves and to throw light on the characteristic methods of these two preeminent playwrights.(book jacket)",,,,,

Here is a young Winston Churchill_ destined to make a profound impact on Ireland_ accompanying his father_ Lord Randolph Churchill_ to Ireland in the Protestant cause_ rising to First Lord of the Admiralty and becoming chief architect of the Gallipoli catastrophe. Wealthy_ beautiful Anglo industrialist Countess Caroline Weed Hubble_ who has never overcome her unrequited love for Conor Larkin_ weaves her way like a single thread through the lives of the Larkin family_ ultimately using her influence with Churchill in a dangerous gambit.(from the publisher)",,,,,

Antigone,Drama and Plays,"""Antigone"" was originally produced in Paris in 1942_ when France was an occupied nation and part of Hitler's Europe. The play depicts an authoritarian regime and the play's central character_ the young Antigone_ mirrored the predicament of the French people in the grips of tyranny. Based on Sophocles ancient Greek tragedy of the same title_ which was first performed in Athens in the 5th century BC_ the theme of ""Antigone"" was nevertheless topical. For in Antigone's faithflness to her dead brother and his proper burial and her defiance of the dictator Creon_ the French audience saw its own resistance to the German occupation. The Germans allowed the play to be performed presumably because they found Creon's arguments for dictatorship so convincing.",,,,,

Death Dance: Suspenseful Stories of the Dance Macabre,Fiction_General Fiction_Carole Nelson  Douglas_Bill  Crider_Judy  Crider_John  Lutz,"Is there anything more joyous and life-embracing than the dance? A celebration of movement_ an expression of emotions_ a glorification of the human form_ dance can be a vehicle for romance_ emotional healing_ self-expression_ or even a ritual of seeking rain_ abundant harvests_ and fertile_ happy unions.

The fourteen stories of this unusual anthology are of the dance put to other_ darker uses. Here it appears as the means of luring prey_ a cold business proposition_ a hard-fought competition and aggression_ an expression of misogyny_ a manifestation of an unhealthy mind and even a pathway to madness. The stories contain strong plot lines and dénouements that are both plausible and satisfying_ but the moods they evoke_ their settings_ and the characters they reveal are refreshingly varied.

Three Plays,Drama and Plays_German,Three plays representative of an important period in twentieth-century drama! A good part of modern drama owes its techniques and its intense awareness of social and psychological problems to the German playwright who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1912. Hauptmanns achievements had great influence on many outstanding writers_ among them Eugene ONeill_ who felt a special indebtedness to the European master. These three plays are superb examples of Hauptmanns wide range and offer students an opportunity to become acquainted with the work of a supremely accomplished writer. The Weavers_ perhaps his most famous play_ reveals the bitter lives of the wretched handweavers of the 1840s and their abortive rebellion. Hannele centers on an abused_ motherless child_ abandoned to a poorhouse_ who creates her own fantasy world of dreams and legends. The Beaver Coat is a delightful satire about a washerwoman who quickly learns that she cannot advance very far through honest labor alone_ and proceeds accordingly,,,,,

Eliot_William Butler  Yeats_Federico  García Lorca_Bertolt  Brecht_Carl  Sternheim_Arthur  Schnitzler_Jean  Cocteau_Georg  Büchner_Alfred de  Musset_Henry  Becque_John  Gay,"The Threepenny Opera was Brecht's first and greatest commercial success_ and it remains one of his best-loved and most-performed plays. Based on John Gay's eighteenth-century Beggar's Opera_ the play is set in Victorian England's Soho but satirizes the bourgeois society of the Weimar Republic through its wry love story of Polly Peachum and ""Mack the Knife"" Macheath. With Kurt Weill's music_ which was one of the earliest and most successful attempts to introduce jazz into the theater_ it became a popular hit throughout the Western world.",,,,,
Der gute Mensch von Sezuan,Drama and Plays_German,The Good Person of Szechwan is one of Bertolt Brechts most popular works. When three gods come to earth in search of a thoroughly good person_ they encounter Shen Teh_ a goodhearted but penniless prostitute_ who offers them shelter.

The Good Person of Szechwan is a masterpiece of minimalist design and elegance that shines a light on human nature and social mores.,,,,,

Written at the close of World War II_ the story is set in the Caucasus Mountains of Georgia_ and retells the tale of King Solomon and a child claimed by two mothers. A chalk circle is metaphorically drawn around a society misdirected in its priorities. Brecht's statements about class are cloaked in the innocence of a fable that whispers insistently to the audience,,,,,
Leben Eduards des zweiten von England,Drama and Plays_Historical_Christopher  Marlowe,Based on Christopher Marlowe's classic of the same name_ Bertolt Brecht's Edward II departs widely from its source. Brecht has made a multitude of technical changes calculated to streamline the play_ with a smaller cast and simpler action_ and he has created virtually new and totally compelling characters with is extravagant variations on Anne_ Edward's queen_ and Mortimer_ the villain of the piece. Brecht also reinterprets Marlowe's famously homosexual protagonist_ crating an Edward initially more crudely homoerotic and ultimately more truly heroic. Brecht's Edward is a hero for the modern era: an existential hero defying a meaningless universe with his courage.,,,,,

The Jew of Malta,Drama and Plays_English_Elizabethan,Marlowe's Jew of Malta must be reckoned one of the most imaginative creations of Elizabethan drama_ without known sources or antecedents either for the main events of the plot_ or for its protagonist Barabas.

In such stories as ""Spunk_"" ""The Gilded Six-Bits_"" and ""The Conscience of the Court_"" Hurston's customary use of metaphor and black dialect enriches her simple narratives and brings her characters vividly to life. Folklore_ the cornerstone of Hurston's fiction_ is integral to such stories as ""Cock Robin Beale Street_"" ""Book of Harlem_"" and ""'Possum or Pig?"" Biblical themes_ another trademark Hurston offering_ appear in ""The Seventh Veil"" and ""The Bone of Contention."" These and the other stories in this collection map_ in rich language and imagery_ Hurston's development and concerns as a writer and provide an invaluable reflection of the mind and imagination of the author of the acclaimed novel Their Eyes Were Watching God.(from the publisher)",,,,,

Doktor Faustus,Fiction_General Fiction_Literary Fiction/classics,A modern reworking of the Faust legend_ in which Germany sells its soul to the Devil. Mann's protagonist_ the composer Adrian Leverkühn_ is the flower of German culture_ a brilliant_ isolated_ overreaching figure_ his radical new music a breakneck game played by art at the very edge of impossibility. In return for twenty-four years of unparalleled musical accomplishment_ he bargains away his souland the ability to love his fellow man.Leverkühn's life story is a brilliant allegory of the rise of the Third Reich_ of Germany's renunciation of its own humanity and its embrace of ambition and nihilism.

Der Zauberberg,Fiction_General Fiction_Literary Fiction/classics_Pawel  Huelle,"Hans Castorp - on the verge of an intense flirtation with Clavdia Chauchat_ a married woman and feverish fellow patient - is perched high above the world_ dozing in his splendid lounge chair at the International Sanatorium Berghof_ swaddled in blankets against the Alpine chill. To his surprise and secret delight_ he will remain on this ""magic mountain"" for seven years - removed from the ""real"" world_ but irresistibly drawn into the sanatorium's own complex_ vertiginous society_ which in Mann's hands becomes a microcosm for Western civilization and its interior life on the eve of the First World War. Flooded with feeling_ with powerful evocations of disease_ with the glories of the natural world and inklings of the supernatural_ The Magic Mountain is equally remarkable for Mann's treatment of time - the ""flatland time"" of healthy_ active people and the ""inelastic present"" of the ""people up here_"" for whom illness is a lifelong career. Mann is a master at drawing dazzling characters with the finest irony: Settembrini_ the impassioned Italian liberal_ and Naphta_ the caustic Jewish Jesuit_ whose opposing worldviews trap them in a grotesque duel; Mynheer Peeperkorn_ the enormously wealthy Dutch planter whose garrulous ""personality"" all but overwhelms his fellow patients; the blustery Director Behrens and subtle Dr. Krokowski_ whose combined energies rule the day and the night of the Berghof; Clavdia Chauchat_ the elusive Russian beauty whose slinking charms can awaken forgotten love; and_ of course_ Hans Castorp himself - the ordinary made extraordinary - whose interior journey leads him out into a blinding snowstorm and a stunning_ fleeting moment of revelation; Hans_ who is last seen on a battlefield of the Great War - the very conflict toward which every word of the novel has been magnetized",,,,,

These commonplace occurrences_ intrinsically the same_ vary slightly as they recur in each succeeding generation. Yet as the Buddenbrooks family eventually succumbs to the seductions of modernityseductions that are at variance with its own traditionsits downfall becomes certain. In scope_ richness of detail_ and humanity_ ""Buddenbrooks"" surpasses all other modern family chronicles; it has_ indeed_ proved a model for most of them.",,,,,

With the modest pride of a professional_ Krull retraces the course of his extraordinary career from a sweet but hardly innocent child to manhood when his genius for theft_ impersonation_ and sensual adventure came to full flower. In these ""confessions"" the irony that underlies even Mann's most serious work is transformed into high comedy_ ribald farce_ brilliant parody. Begun in 1911_ laid aside_ then resumed after a span of some forty years_ this first volume of a projected trilogy is a marvel of sustained inspiration. It is a memorable tour de force in which the author's lifelong fascination with the ambiguous relationship between art and morality achieves final expression with Mann assuming the voice of an enchanting charlatan to bid the world a smiling farewell. George Steiner calls Confessions ""a garland of laughter"" laid upon the ""monumental facade"" of Mann's work.",,,,,
Die Betrogene,Fiction_General Fiction_Literary Fiction/classics,Thomas Mann's bold and disturbing novella_ written in 1952_ is the feminine counterpart of his masterpiece Death in Venice.

Lotte in Weimar,"Fiction_Historical_European_Germany, Austria, Switzerland_General Fiction_Literary Fiction/classics_Footnote Fiction",Thomas Mann_ fascinated with the concept for genius and with the richness of German culture_ found in Johann Wolfgang von Goethe the embodiment of the German culture hero.
