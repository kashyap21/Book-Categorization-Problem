The Young Oxford Book of Aliens,Fiction_Children & Young Adult_Science Fiction_Aliens_Damon  Knight_Murray  Leinster_Philip K.  Dick_Harry  Harrison,"There was a greenish_ hellish tinge to the light within the metal cube. It was a light that made the dead-white skin of the creature seated at the controls seem faintly green.'
This collection brings together a wide range of stories about aliens and encounters with aliens. Some are hostile invaders of Earth_ others friendly and more generous visitors--though not all of them are as friendly as they would like us to believe.
The stories range back into time and deep into the future. You can invade the moon_ hunt and be hunted_ encounter Judgement Day and the end of the world_ and have an alien as a pen pal (not advisable).
On Earth you'll meet Keva_ the genius from Planet Echo; the father-thing (from who knows where); the warrior Broghoke_ the savages who threaten the underdwellers; and the snake-like_ hypnotic Fascinators. Out in Space you will be abducted with Tina to the planet Shana; meet the beautiful metamorph Rea; and suffer within Itin the crisis of faith that faces the innocent amphibians of planet Wesker. And more.
Some of the stories are by well-known science fiction writers such as Arthur C. Clarke_ Avram Davidson_ Philip K. Dick_ Harry Harrison_ and A.E. van Vogt; others_ by Marian Abbey_ Francis Beckett_ Stephen Bowkett_ and Sue Welford have been specially written for this exciting and enthralling book.

The game is afoot_ and the four footed are its most cunning players in Crafty Cat Crimes. In one hundred cagey cat-tale mysteries_ the largest literary litter of kitty crimestoppers ever convened in one volume prowl the mean streets in pursuit of feline felons_ justice_ just desserts--and the occasional pat on the head.

You don't have to be a cat lover to enjoy these stories of crime and intrigue. You just have to like challenging mysteries where a twist in the tale comes naturally. There is virtually no crime these cats don't put the paw on. Whether confronted with cat burglary_ catnapping_ or murder most foul_ they work through seemingly insoluble puzzles with a stealth_ feline finickiness_ and silent grace that are the envy of their two-footed counterparts.

Crafty Cat Crimes includes selections to suit every reader's taste: cat cozies for the domestic-minded_ comic cat capers that look at the funny side of human and animal relationships_ even hardboiled escapades that mix cats and gats.
