After Many a Summer Dies the Swan,Fiction_General Fiction,A Hollywood millionaire with a terror of death_ whose personal physician happens to be working on a theory of longevity--these are the elements of Huxley's caustic and entertaining satire on man's desire to live indefinitely
Ape and Essence,Fiction_Science Fiction,"When Aldous Huxley's Brave New World first appeared in 1932_ it presented in terms of purest fantasy a society bent upon self-destruction. Few of its outraged critics anticipated the onset of another world war with its Holocaust and atomic ruin. In 1948_ seeing that the probable shape of his anti-utopia had been altered inevitably by the facts of history_ Huxley wrote Ape and Essence.  In this savage novel_ using the form of a film scenario_ he transports us to the year 2108. The setting is Los Angeles where a ""rediscovery expedition"" from New Zealand is trying to make sense of what is left. From chief botanist Alfred Poole we learn_ to our dismay_ about the 22nd-century way of life"

Denis's stay proves to be a disaster amid his weak attempts to attract the girl of his dreams and the ridicule he endures regarding his plan to write a novel about love and art."
Time Must Have a Stop,Fiction_General Fiction,"Sebastian Barnack_ a handsome English schoolboy_ goes to Italy for the summer_ and there his real education begins. His teachers are two quite different men: Bruno Rontini_ the saintly bookseller_ who teaches him about things spiritual; and Uncle Eustace_ who introduces him to life's profane pleasures. The novel that Aldous Huxley himself thought was his most successful at ""fusing idea with story_"" Time Must Have A Stop is part of Huxley's lifelong attempt to explore the dilemmas of twentieth-century man and to create characters who_ though ill-equipped to solve the dilemmas_ all go stumbling on in their painfully serious comedies (in this novel we have the dead atheist who returns in a seance to reveal what he has learned after death but is stuck with a second-rate medium who garbles his messages)."
Owl Moon,Fiction_Children & Young Adult_Picture Books,A father and his child take a walk in the woods at night to go owling.

Richly detailed and vividly plotted_ Fabian remains an unparalleled personalization of the collapse of the Weimar Republic.

Stalky and Co.,Fiction_General Fiction,Stalky & Co. is quite unlike any other collection of school stories_ revealing new possibilities and depths. Kipling portrays school as the first stage of a much larger game_ a pattern-maker for the experiences of life. Implied throughout the stories is the question 'What happened to these fifteen-year-old boys_ and how did the lessons they learned at school apply to the world of warfare and imperial government?'.

As the case progresses_ Professor Pelletier--intrepid researcher_ defender of women's rights_ and soldier on the front lines of the fight for academic progress--finds herself doing battle not only with an unknown killer but also with her own department chair; being threatened by the president of the board of trustees; and falling victim to the aristocratic charms of her college president.Any one of these peccadilloes_ she realizes_ might easily spell academic death to an untenured member of the faculty. And_ in an ironic twist on the old professorial adage_ it begins to look as if Karen's determination to publish (the biography of a woman whose writing her colleagues look upon as trash) might actually cause her to perish--professionally_ and perhaps in the decidedly non-metaphoric sense as well."
The Raven and the Nightingale: A Modern Mystery of Edgar Allan Poe,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives_Amateur,An unexpected bequest sends waves of violence through the placid groves of academe in Joanne Dobson's third mystery to feature Professor Karen Pelletier.Still untenured_ and therefore on shaky academic ground_ feisty young Enfield College professor Pelletier finds herself going head-to-head with the resident Edgar Allan Poe expert_ Elliot Corbin_ an academic windbag of monumental proportions who is lobbying to be appointed to the much-coveted and recently vacated Palaver Chair. So when Karen receives a serendipitous bonanza in the form of never-before-seen manuscripts and journals by the nineteenth-century poet Emmeline Foster_ who is rumored to have killed herself for the love of Poe_ Corbin is predictably put out.Subsequently_ the corrosive Corbin is stabbed to death in his home on Thanksgiving Day. Karen has an airtight alibi_ but other suspects abound--from the head of the women's studies program_ who also pines for the Palaver Chair; to Visiting Poet Jane Birdwort_ whose history with Corbin turns out to be far longer (and closer) than anyone had known; to the perpetually disgruntled department secretary; to a young female adjunct professor whose unbridled ambition will not be denied.Then Karen's office is ransacked_ and a number of the Emmeline Foster journals and poems are stolen_ so it looks more and more as if Corbin's death may be inextricably entwined with the muse of his life--poet of the macabre_ Edgar Allan Poe. The undeniably attractive Lieutenant Piotrowski is called in_ and_ as in the past_ he solicits Karen's help_ involving her once more in the thankless task of investigating her not-always-so-collegial colleagues

Cold and Pure and Very Dead,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives_Amateur,English professor Karen Pelletier is well known for her provocative manner and iconoclastic opinions_ so it's no surprise that she perversely cites a commercial novel from the 1950s when asked to named the greatest book of the twentieth century. The only work by Mildred Deakin_ who disappeared from public view shortly after its publication_ Satan Mills quickly becomes the hottest book around. It's the center of contentious arguments in academic circles_ climbs onto The New York Times bestseller list_ and receives the coveted honor of being an Oprah Book Club selection. At the height of the frenzy_ a reporter who discovers the reclusive author in rural upstate New York is found dead in her driveway. Could Deakin have been so protective of her privacy that she'd shoot someone to protect it?Called in to help with the investigation_ Karen learns that the scandalous happenings at the heart of Satan Mills were more autobiographical than its attractive young author wanted anyone to know. The intrepid professor deploys all her literary and investigative skills in an all-out effort to exonerate the embattled older woman and restore her peaceful existence
The Maltese Manuscript,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives_Amateur,In classic noir tradition_ English Professor Karen Pelletier gains a client when her office door opens and a famous Private Eye novelist enters. The author is dogged by Trouble (a Rottweiler) and by a problem. And since Sunnye Hardcastle (a Patricia Cornwell lookalike) will be a featured speaker in the English Department's upcoming conference on the murder mystery (from a Feminist Perspective)_ Karen is intrigued. The next thing you know_ one midnight someone rushes out of the Enfield library with an armload of rare books. In fact_ the library is missing a truckload of its treasures. Then a suspect is found dead in the stacks_ his neck broken. With a real private eye on the case_ the hunt is on?for the manuscript of Hammett's famous novel_ The Maltese Falcon_ for the missing books_ and for potential murder suspects. A sparkling fifth entry in an award-nominated series by Fordham University professor Joanne Dobson riffs the hardboiled genre and several sacred icons. What is truth? What is fiction? No one seems certain. Perhaps most frustrated is Karen's boyfriend_ Massachusetts police lieutenant Charlie Piotrowski_ a man having trouble dividing his personal and professional life_ let alone translating modern academic-speak

San Francisco is the ideal place for murder_ mystery_ and malevolence. Far beneath the swinging coils of the Golden Gate Bridge_ in a dank set of abandoned prison cells_ a strange caretaker with evil intentions plots his nefarious deeds.

Stakeout on Page Street and other DKA files,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives_Private Detective,"More the 30 years ago a young private investigator named Joe Gores was encouraged by the great mystery critic Anthony Boucher to record his experiences in a series of short stories for Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine. Thus began the first series of tales that looked at a PI's cases as they actually happened_ from the very serious (for instance_ when a repo-man  someone who repossesses cars when loans are in default  can send a woman to suicide) to the comic (as when the Dan Kearny associates have to grab a fire engine that hasn't been paid for). And the characters are just as colorful_ ranging from professional conmen to a gypsy who issues a curse as her car is driven away.

All Shall Be Well,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives_General,When Margaret Bellamy tells Superintendent Duncan Kincaid that she'd agreed to help Kincaid's downstairs neighbor Jasmine Dent end her cancer-stricken life but then couldn't go through with it_ Kincaid wonders if somebody else assisted Jasmine's suicide--or gave her a lethal dose of morphine for less helpful reasons altogether. The potential motives of the suspects--Jasmine's ineffectual brother Theo_ who's failed at one small business after another; her basement neighbor Major Keith_ a devoted gardener who served in India at the same time Jasmine was born; home-help nurse Felicity Howarth_ who wants to refuse her thousand-pound legacy; and Meg's grasping boyfriend Roger Leveson-Gower_ who's counting on her coming into money--seem commonplace enough; but Kincaid and his sergeant Gemma James_ their path lit by entries from Jasmine's journal_ uncover an entirely unexpected new motive.
Leave the Grave Green,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives_General,Scotland Yard investigators Duncan Kincaid and Gemma James venture out from London to find answers to the death of Connor Swann_ son-in-law of a well-known couple: a famous conductor and a honored opera singer. Swann has been found floating in a Thames River lock_ and when he's fished out_ it's obvious he has been strangled. Because he was estranged from his wife_ she's automatically a suspect. What Duncan and Gemma uncover in the course of their inquiry is that the couple--the conductor and the opera singer--also had a son who drowned many years ago while in his sister's company. Of course it's in Duncan and Gemma's professional best interests to find out if there's a connection between the two events.
Mourn Not Your Dead,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives_General,The love affair between Superintendent Duncan Kincaid and Sergeant Gemma James that began so uncertainly in the final pages of Leave the Grave Green is abruptly curtailed by the news that Superintendent Alastair Gilbert_ the divisional commander down at Notting Dale_ has been found dead in his kitchen. Some missing jewelry points to the burglar who for months has been taking the oddest trinkets from the villagers of Holmbury St. Mary. But there are deeper waters_ too: Kincaid and James find little love for the scheming_ manipulative Gilbert anywhere in the pacific village_ from the wife who had grown out of love with him and into love with her business partner to the staff officer Gilbert had leapfrogged for promotion.
Dreaming of the Bones,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives_General,When talented and tormented poet Lydia Brooke dies_ it is assumed that she has taken her own life. Now obsession has taken hold of Victoria McClellan. A feminist biographer at Cambridge_ Vic finds herself immersed in the poet's world. Uneasy about the manner of Lydia's death_ Vic calls on her ex-husband_ Scotland Yard Superintendent Duncan Kincaid_ for help. But before he can take action_ Vic herself is dead--and there's no question that this one is murder. As Kincaid and his lover and partner_ Gemma James_ investigate_ they are exposed to secrets that have reached out over three decades and poisoned a dozen lives.
Kissed a Sad Goodbye,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives_General,"The call from Scotland Yard couldn't have come at a worse time for Duncan Kincaid. He has promised the weekend to Kit_ the eleven-year-old son of his ex-wife. The son he never knew he fathered--who doesn't yet know Kincaid's true identity. But Duncan's best intentions are shattered by a case that draws him in and consumes his interest.
A young woman's body has been found in the tall grass of East London's Mudchute Park_ her jacket and short skirt carefully arranged to preserve her modesty. It seems too odd a detail for a simple case of robbery or assault gone awry. And indeed the case becomes more complex when the dead woman is identified as Annabelle Hammond_ bold and brilliant head of a family-owned tea company. For the victim was a mystery even to those who knew her best.
Alluring_ headstrong_ and ambitious_ with looks no man could forget_ Annabelle was the sort of woman who inspired the strongest of emotions...passion certainly_ jealousy_ anger_ even obsession. And when Duncan and Gemma fan out to question anyone connected to her_ it doesn't take long to discover that the lady was also adept at keeping secrets...especially from those she loved.
As the detectives try to penetrate Annabelle's tangled affairs to glean the motive of her killer_ their list of suspects grows to include her suave_ upper-class fiancé; the handsome street musician who may have been the last person to see her alive; her sister's vengeful ex-husband; even her own father. But what they don't know is that this case has long roots that reach far back into the past_ and that resentments that should have been long buried still have the power to hurt_ and maybe even the capacity to kill."
A Finer End,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives_General,When Duncan Kincaids cousin Jack calls from Glastonbury to ask for his help on a rather unusual matter_ Duncan welcomes the chance to spend a relaxing weekend outside of London with Gemma--but relaxation isnt on the agenda. Glastonbury is revered as the site of an ancient abbey_ the mythical burial place of King Arthur and Guinevere_ and a source of strong druid power. Jack has no more than a passing interest in its history--until he comes across an extraordinary chronicle almost a thousand years old. The record reveals something terrible and bloody shattered the abbeys peace long ago--knowledge that will spark violence that reaches into the present. Soon it is up to Duncan and Gemma to find the truth the local police cannot see. But no one envisions the peril that lies ahead--or that there is more at stake than they ever dreamed possible.
And Justice There is None,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives_General,"Gemma James is adjusting to professional and personal changes that include her eagerly sought promotion to the rank of inspector--and a future now intricately entwined with Duncan Kincaid. But her new responsibilities are put to the test when she is placed in charge of a particularly brutal homicide: The lovely young wife of a wealthy antiques dealer has been found murdered on fashionable Notting Hill.
Dawn Arrowood was six weeks pregnant. Her lover_ Alex Dunn_ a porcelain dealer in Londons bustling Portobello Market_ appears absolutely devastated by her death_ but Gemmas the main focus of investigation is soon Karl Arrowood_ who had the most powerful motive for killing his unfaithful wife. But this case sets off warning bells for Duncan: its far too similar to an unsolved murder in which an antiques dealer was killed in precisely the same way and when the escalating violence claims yet another victim_ he and Gemma find themselves at increasing odds with each other--as two separate investigations become linked in the most startling of ways. Their hunt for a killer will traverse the teeming stalls of the citys antiques markets to a decades-in-the-making vendetta of history and hatred that has been honed to a flawless_ deadly point. To solve this case_ Gemma and Duncan must walk a merciless razors edge through a place where true justice will be a long time coming."
Insect Dreams: The Half Life of Gregor Samsa,Fiction_Fantasy_General Fiction_Literary Fiction/classics_Footnote Fiction_Franz  Kafka,"It seems the Samsas' chambermaid only claimed to sweep into the dustbin the twentieth century's most remarkable contemplative. Instead_ having spirited him from his bedchamber_ she apparently sold the metamorphosed Gregor to a Viennese sideshow_ where-it being 1915-he could earn his living lecturing carnival crowds on the implications of Rilke and Herr Spengler.
In this delightfully original work of imagination_ compassion_ and good reason_ we follow the trajectory of Kafka's salesman-turned-cockroach across two continents and thirty years as he touches the most significant flash points of his time."

Gray-skinned and brutish_ designed to do the dangerous and dull jobs no one else wants. At corporate giant Galapagos Wetware_ business is booming. Buyers want creatures with more finesse. They want workers who are good with handguns and who have the ability to deceive. Workers who are cunning_ who thrive on terror_ who are indifferent to a plea for mercy. They want workers who look more human.
The prototypes are emerging slowly in the ice-cold lab. Briggss code is like poetry_ like perfectly structured haiku. He begins to add forbidden detailsa sense of humor_ mathematical brilliance_ an instinct for music_ a profound longing. With each detail Briggs adds_ the more infatuated he becomes_ until he adds the most dangerous detail of allthe ability to reproduce.
In the bowels of Galapagos Wetware_ in a room filled with blue-tinted snow_ Hal Briggs watches as his latest creationhe has named her Kayblows him a kiss_ while Jack_ the male next to her_ mouths_ Dont worry.
What could possibly go wrong?"
The Book of Dreams,Fiction_General Fiction_Rich & Famous,Warren Hodges_ head of International Pictures_ lives in a house like a Norman castle with a view of the Pacific. Marta Brooks_ blond and beautiful_ takes classified ads for the Romance Advertiser. Victor Shaw has spent time in Soledad state prison but understands that his future lies in blackmail. Taylor Hayden_ a good hit man_ shines his shoes and doesn't ask questions. Zimba_ a performing elephant_ is not as reliable as he looks. This is Hollywood_ and Craig Nova makes it seem perfectly logical that these creatures should find themselves in the same cast. In his swift_ lyrical prose_ comic and moving_ Nova weaves disparate lives together into a novel that makes utter beauty out of the gritty and grotesque. This is a story about people who are willing to take the chance they have been waiting for all their lives_ men and women trying to live up to their dreams. The Book of Dreams is also a book about California_ that youthful place prematurely aged by the burden of too much longing and desire. And the look of the place_ with its heartbreaking_ ever-receding landscape (seen most often through car windows)_ haunts this novel.(from the publisher)
Pest Control,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Crime/Caper_General Fiction_Humor,A sweetly comic thriller that finally answers the age-old question: What if a sad-sack New York exterminator got his antennae crossed with the professionals who wipe out Homo sapiens? At his wit's (and checkbook's) end after walking off his job killing bugs with lethal cocktails_ Bob Dillon schemes at his own unique approach to extermination: breeding predatory strains of insects who'll feast on termites and roaches without developing chemical-resistant new strains of pests or loading the planet with hazardous toxins. It's a plan with all the makings of an American success story_ but it spins out of control when Bob's ad falls into the hands of a middleman who brokers assassinations and thinks Bob's sobriquet of ``the Exterminator'' is a veiled reference to his status as a hit man. Getting a faint whiff of the trouble in his future_ Bob begs off the lucrative job he's offered. But when the victim is accidentally killed anyway_ the middleman_ assuming Bob's managed the job with unusual finesse_ duly sends him his fee. So far_ everything's as innocuous as the endless stream of double-entendres about extermination--except that (1) the UPS package with all that lovely money gets held up en route to Bob; (2) his wife and daughter_ impatient with his uncompromisingly idealistic approach to pest control_ walk out on him; and (3) the brother and murderer of a Bolivian druglord who wants to cover up his own crime screams that it was the work of the Exterminator and offers a $10 million bounty to whoever kills Bob--attracting all the top exterminators in the field. There's the subtle Chinese knife expert_ the glamorous Frenchwoman_ the parvenu Cowboy_ the transvestite dwarf_ and the melancholy_ suicidal top man_ whose unlikely friendship with his prospective target is the high point of this generally predictable tale.
Voyage to the North Star,Fiction_Adventure_Military and Naval Adventure,"America is marching headlong into the Depression. Unemployment is rife_ Reds are protesting in New York's streets_ but on the waterfront Prohibition has failed to water down the beer. The rich are meanwhile getting richer_ and the poor only more destitute_ in this powerfully wrought novel that crosses the paths of two men from opposite ends of the social spectrum. 

While the industrialist and sometime big-game hunter Carl Schenck has amassed a fortune fabulous enough to expect the world to cater to his whims_ seaman Will Boden has lost his boat_ his wife_ and his reputation. Second chances don't come easily to a captain who's abandoned his own ship - until Schenck's determination to organize an Arctic safari presents Boden with the opportunity to do what no seasoned seaman would: to navigate a luxuriously appointed but ill-equipped yacht_ the Lodestar_ through perilous Polar waters. 

Its adventure as harrowing as a tale by Jack London_ its vision as haunting as Joseph Conrad's_ this remarkable novel pitches the master and crew of the Lodestar into the grip of treacherous Arctic seas and moral disaster."
The Ice Child,Fiction_Adventure_Survival_General_General Fiction_Tragedy And Loss,"When Jo Harper falls in love with a maverick archaeologist_ Doug Marshall_ she also falls into Doug's obsession with one of history's greatest mysteries of exploration: one hundred fifty years ago_ Sir John Franklin and his crew of one hundred twenty men sailed two ships to the Arctic on a surveying trip and were never seen again. Doug has spent his entire life in search of an answer to what happened to them_ sacrificing his first marriage and his relationship with his son_ John_ along the way.

God's Fool,Fiction_Historical,"Born attached at the chest_ Chang and Eng were considered a marvel_ an omen_ an act of God_ evidence of His glory or proof of His wrath. Uniquely cursed_ enslaved to one another for life_ they were a joke of nature variously feared and abhorred_ disturbing our most basic assumptions about the human condition. Mark Sloukas dazzling achievement in Gods Fool is the ease and compassion with which he draws the story of one human being from this ghastly predicament. Looking beyond the twins physical connection_ he imagines one mans life of ordinary grace and suffering_ longing and resistance_ and the ties of love_ as well as of blood_ that bind and redeem us all. 

By any standard_ theirs is a history of epic variety and drama. Their birth_ to an illiterate fishmonger_ sent midwives screaming from the room. Condemned to death_ they survived to be brought_ at the age of thirteen_ to the Royal Palace in Bangkok for an audience with King Rama III. At seventeen_ laboring as merchants on the Meklong River_ they saw their world erased by a typhoon. Consigned for three hundred pounds to an opium trader by their mother_ who was desperate to ensure their survival_ they sailed for Europe. There they entertained kings and counselors in salons and drawing rooms from Brussels to Rome_ and_ in Paris_ met the woman who would divide them as no surgeon ever could.

When the culture that had lifted them up inevitably cast them down_ they landed in the flophouses of London_ where_ penniless and starving_ they were discovered by Phineas T. Barnum_ who packed them off to America along with an assortment of bearded ladies and two-headed calves_ albino beauties and dog boys_ German midgets and twelve-fingered flute players. Leaving Barnum at the height of their fame to take a last stab at normal life_ they settled in North Carolina_ where_ despite the tensions growing between them_ they found_ for a time_ tranquillity as farmers and slave owners_ marrying a pair of sisters and fathering_ between them_ twenty children. Their peace_ however_ would prove to be short-lived.

Arthur and the knights are reluctant to accept the aid of a dragon with magical powers and even more reluctant to draw on twentieth-century knowledge for help. Eckert has to be diplomat_ warrior_ and puzzle solver all at once_ then_ and quickly. Dickson's is a distinctly original take on the Matter of Britain (which_ to be sure_ is supposed to have transpired a good many centuries earlier than in these yarns)_ distinguished by the humor arising out of the contrast between popular notions about the Middle Ages and its frequently grisly realities.

Arrowsmith,Fiction_Science Fiction_Hard Science_Medicine_General Fiction_Humor_Satire,"publisher synopsis
Martin Arrowsmith's singular_ if somewhat ascetic_ devotion to science affords Sinclair Lewis his most dramatic opportunity to portray an American whose work become his life. Forced to give up successive sinecuresinstructor in medicine_ small-town doctor_ research pathologistby obstacles ranging from public ignorance to the publicity-mindedness of a great foundation_ Arrowsmith becomes virtually isolated as a seeker of truth. Even so_ Lewis' poignant thesis would seem to be that American idealism cannot beget true tragedy_ because its adherents lack a sympathetic audience and their stumbling-blocks are_ for the most part_ petty. Observing the Nobel Prize-winning author's double gifts for satire and realism_ E. M. Forster said_ ""He has lodged a piece of Continent in the world's imagination"" and André Maurois proclaimed him ""a great novelist."""
Catmagic,Fiction_Horror_Witches & Warlocks,"Some people in Maywell_ New Jersey commute to New York. Some are working on a lab project that will change the worldif it is allowed to succeed.

If she is allowed to live long enough to make the choice.

Amanda's tale is far stranger than she knows. It is ancient beyond memory. In times of great change it must be relived_ in all its fear and hope_ its wisdom and its passion.

One of those times is now."

The Year's Best Mystery and Suspense Stories 1989,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Suspense_Bill  Pronzini_Carl  Martin_Bill  Crenshaw_Edward D.  Hoch_Judith  O'Neill_Loren D.  Estleman_Sara  Paretsky_Clark  Howard_Peter  Lovesey_Linda O.  Johnston_Michael  Collins,"Edited by: Edward D. Hoch

This is the fourteenth edition of Edward D. Hoch's distinguished collection of mystery-suspense short fiction.  His choices reflect an unusually strong year for private-eye stories_ in this centenniary of Raymond Chandler's birth.  Five of these twelve stories feature private-investigator protagonists from established mystery novel series_ though the stories themselves are far from the traditional P.I. caper.  Their diversity demonstrates how flexible that tradition has become as more and more such stories are published in the United States_ especially in magazines.

These tales are no longer strictly whodunit puzzlers of the Hammett-Chandler school.  Michael Collins_ for example_ in ""Crime and Punishment_"" grapples with the larger theme of the moral implications of the modern living.  Loren D. Estleman_ one of the best contemporary P.I. writers_ and his character Amos Walker_ make of the Detroit of ""The Crooked Way"" an instance of the use of setting as character which is equal to that accomplished by Ross MacDonald for California.  And these are only two of the five.

In the remaining stories_ subject matter_ tone_ and milieu are so far-ranging as to give the anthology an eclectic flavor_ with something included to please almost every mystery reader's taste.  Bill Crenshaw leads the pack with ""Flicks_"" the Edgar Allen Poe Award winner for Best Mystery Short Story of the Year.  Only one British author joins the rank: Peter Lovesey with ""The Wasp.""  There are usually more but_ as Ed Hoch sees it_ American writers dominated the genre this past year; as this collection is bound to dominate anthologies in the genre."

A Matter of Crime #3: New Stories from the Masters of Mystery and Suspense,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Suspense_Michael  Collins_Loren D.  Estleman,""
Babbitt,Fiction_General Fiction_Humor_Satire,On the surface_ Babbitt appears to be the quintessential middle-class embodiment of conservative values and enthusiasm for the well-to-do lifestyle for the small entrepreneur. But beneath the complacent facade_ he also experiences a rising_ nameless discontent. These feelings eventually lead Babbitt into risky escapades that threaten his family and his standing in the community.
Elmer Gantry,Fiction_Religious_Christianity_General Fiction_Humor_Satire,"Today universally recognized as a landmark in American literature_ Elmer Gantry scandalized readers when it was first published_ causing Sinclair Lewis to be ""invited"" to a jail cell in New Hampshire and to his own lynching in Virginia. His portrait of a golden-tongued evangelist who rises to power within his churcha saver of souls who lives a life of hypocrisy_ sensuality_ and ruthless self-indulgenceis also the record of a period_ a reign of grotesque vulgarity_ which but for Lewis would have left no record of itself. Elmber Gantry has been called the greatest_ most vital_ and most penetrating study of hyposcriy that has been written since Voltaire.(from the publisher)"
Free Air,Fiction_General Fiction,A pretty girl in a Rolls-Royce passes through a sleepy small town_ inspiring the local mechanic to quit his job and follow her across the continent in his beloved rattletrap to fabled California. This romantic tale serves as the framing story for Lewis's observations based on his and his wife Grace's real-life automobile trip across the United States.
Hike and the Aeroplane,Fiction_Children & Young Adult_Adventure,"This boy's adventure story_ Lewis's first novel_ was written under the pseudonym ""Tom Graham"". (""I hope the kids will find it not too much of a bore_"" wrote Lewis on a copy autographed to his brother Claude and family.)"
If I Were Boss: The Early Business Stories of Sinclair Lewis,Fiction_General Fiction_Humor_Satire,"Among Lewis's funniest satires_ these stories introduce the characters_ themes_ and techniques that would evolve into Babbitt. Each selection reflects the commercial culture of Lewis's day_ particularly Reason Why advertising_ self-help manuals_ and the business fiction of the Saturday Evening Post. The stories were published between October 1915 and May 1921 (nine in the Saturday Evening Post_ four in Metropolitan Magazine_ one in Harper's Magazine_ and one in American Magazine).
Because some things have not changed in the American workplace since Lewis's day_ these highly entertaining and unflinchingly accurate office satires will appeal to the fans of Dilbert and The Drew Carey Show. In a sense_ they provide lay readers with an archaeology of white-collar angst and regimentation. The horror and absurdities of contemporary corporate downsizing already existed in the office of the Progressive Era. For an audience contemplating the death of the American middle class_ Lewis's stories provide an important retrospective on earlier times and a preliminary autopsy on the American dream.(from the publisher)"
The Innocents: A Story for Lovers,Fiction_Romance_Contemporary,We can't find anyone who remembers the plot of this forgettable novel_ an attempt at a commercially successful romance that failed miserably and was later acknowledged by Lewis as his worst novel. No critic has ever disagreed with him.The picture to the left is a detail of the frontispiece illustration from the novel- it is signed but the artist's name in our scan is too small to be made out.
The Job,Fiction_General Fiction,"Three years before the civic-minded Carol Kennicott came to life in Main Street_ Una Golden was confronting the male dinosaurs of business. Like Carol_ the heroine of The Job is one of Sinclair Lewis's most fully realized creations. Originally published in 1917_ The Job was his first controversial novel. A ""working girl"" in New York City_ Una Goldencaught in the dilemmas of marriage or career_ husband or office_ birth control or motherhoodis the prototype of the businesswoman of popular and literary culture."
Kingsblood Royal,Fiction_General Fiction_Humor_Satire,A neglected tour de force by the first American to win the Nobel Prize in literature_ Kingsblood Royal is a stirring and wickedly funny portrait of a man who resigns from the white race. When Neil Kingsblood a typical middle-American banker with a comfortable life makes the shocking discovery that he has African-American blood_ the odyssey that ensues creates an unforgettable portrayal of two Americas_ one black_ one white.(from the publisher)
Our Mr. Wrenn: The Romantic Adventures of a Gentle Man,Fiction_General Fiction_Humor,A timid office clerk inherits a fortune- nine hundred and forty dollars!- and begins to be attractive to women.
The Trail of the Hawk: A Comedy of the Seriousness of Life,Fiction_Adventure,A clerk with a yearning for the heights finds his destiny (and love?) as the Hawk_ a soaring pioneer of aviation.The first edition of the book (and facsimile reprints thereof) are prized for the frontispiece_ an early painting by Norman Rockwell; the artist's first book illustration (see image_ left).
Ann Vickers,Fiction_General Fiction_Humor_Satire,"Some reviewers were outraged by Ann Vickers when it first appeared in 1933. ""Persons unused to horrid and filthy things had better stay at a safe distance from this book_"" wrote one. Lewis's Ann Vickers is a complex character: a strong-minded prison superintendent dedicated to enlightened social reform_ she also seeks to fulfill herself as a sexual being. Ann Vickers is in all respects her own person_ standing up to the confining rules of her society.(from the publisher)"
Cass Timberlane,Fiction_General Fiction_Humor_Satire,"He was a man's man with a reputation as big and solid as his name. Cass Timberlane. Judge. Age 41. When he wasn't sitting on the bench_ he was with his cronies playing cards or hunting and fishing in the wild rivers and woods that kept him chained to his small home town.

It took a young half-tamed hawk of a girl to change that. The day she walked into his courtroom_ he wanted her. And his desire for Jinny Marshland was to end in a driving passion that bitterly divided a whole townand brought him to the brink of a kind of madness that changed his life."
Dodsworth,Fiction_General Fiction_Humor_Satire,First published in 1929_ Dodsworth tells the story of a young American couple who moves to Europe. When the woman becomes involved with another man_ her husband must choose between forgiving his wife or abandoning the relationship_ and Europe_ forever.
It Can't Happen Here,Fiction_General Fiction_Humor_Satire,"The only one of Sinclair Lewis's later novels to match the power of Main Street_ Babbitt_ and Arrowsmith_ It Can't Happen Here is an alarming_ eerily timeless work. The Chicago Tribune descibed the book as ""written at a white heat_"" for Lewis was outraged as he created it_ tormented by Hitler's aggression_ the murderous events in Franco's Spain_ and nationalism rising in America. This book remains a warning about the fragility of democarcy_ juxtaposing hilarious satires with a blow-by-blow description of a president saving the country from welfare cheaters_ sex_ crime_ and a liberal press by becoming a dictator. Military spokeman General Edgeways and Republican Party activist Mrs. Adelaide Tarr Gimmiitch sound as fresh as a CNN broadcast_ and the eventsfrom Supreme Court nominations to blasts at the mediaappear totally contemporary. A man ahead of his time_ Sinclair Lewis profoundly understood the American character and ripped away smug platitudes to give readers truth. In 1935_ the Springfield Republican called It Can't Happen Here ""a message to thinking Americans."" Thinking Americans still need to hear it.(from the publisher)"
The Scared Stiff,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Crime/Caper,Masterfully devised_ wildly comic_ and nonstop suspenseful_ this madcap tale maps the consequences of an amiable schemer's notion that he might be better off dead-and then the more alarming discovery that he's not dead enough. Con artistry having failed yet again to make Barry Lee rich quick_ he finds himself with only one asset left: his life. Or rather_ the insurance on it. So he and his beautiful South American wife_ Lola_ set out to play the globalization of the insurance industry to their fiduciary advantage. In Lola's native Guerrara_ where corruption comes disguised as efficiency and a coroner thinks it unnecessary to see the corpse before issuing a death certificate_ they successfully stage Barry's spectacular and very public accidental death. However_ Barry's afterlife proves to be more problematic_ especially when Lola's blunt-minded and ham-fisted cousins figure there's less profit in a con than in a corpse. Running through a series of identities from a taxi driver to a Hollywood movie producer_ and running out of lives_ Barry strives to escape the harrowing and often hilarious effects of his own demise.
Pope Joan,Fiction_Historical_European_Medieval,"For a thousand years men have denied her existence--Pope Joan_ the woman who disguised herself as a man and rose to rule Christianity for two years. Now this compelling novel animates the legend with a portrait of an unforgettable woman who struggles against restrictions her soul cannot accept.

When her older brother dies in a Viking attack_ the brilliant young Joan assumes his identity and enters a Benedictine monastery where_ as Brother John Anglicus_ she distinguishes herself as a scholar and healer. Eventually drawn to Rome_ she soon becomes enmeshed in a dangerous mix of powerful passion and explosive politics that threatens her life even as it elevates her to the highest throne in the Western world."
The Surgeon,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Suspense,"In her most masterful novel of medical suspense_ New York Times bestselling author Tess Gerritsen creates a villain of unforgettable evil--and the one woman who can catch him before he kills again.

He slips into their homes at night and walks silently into bedrooms where women lie sleeping_ unaware of the horrors they soon will endure. The precision of the killer's methods suggests he is a deranged man of medicine_ propelling the Boston newspapers and the frightened public to name him ""The Surgeon.""

The cops' only clue rests with another surgeon_ the victim of a nearly identical crime. Two years ago_ Dr. Catherine Cordell fought back and killed her attacker before he could complete his assault. Now she hides her fears of intimacy behind a cool and elegant exterior and a well-earned reputation as a top trauma surgeon. 

Cordell's careful facade is about to crack as this new killer recreates_ with chilling accuracy_ the details of Cordell's own ordeal. With every new murder he seems to be taunting her_ cutting ever closer_ from her hospital to her home. Her only comfort comes from Thomas Moore_ the detective assigned to the case. But even Moore cannot protect Cordell from a brilliant hunter who somehow understands--and savors--the secret fears of every woman he kills.

Filled with the authentic detail that is the trademark of this doctor turned author . . . and peopled with rich and complex characters--from the ER to the squad room to the city morgue--here is a thriller of unprecedented depth and suspense. Exposing the shocking link between those who kill and cure_ punish and protect_ The Surgeon is Tess Gerritsen's most exciting accomplishment yet."

"Ahab's Wife: Or, the Star-Gazer",Fiction_Historical_North America_Nineteenth Century_General Fiction_Literary Fiction/classics_Footnote Fiction,"""Captain Ahab was neither my first husband nor my last."" 

This is destined to be remembered as one of the most-recognized first sentences in literature--along with ""Call me Ishmael."" Sena Jeter Naslund has created an entirely new universe with a transcendent heroine at its center who will be every bit as memorable as Captain Ahab. 

Ahab's Wife is a novel on a grand scale that can legitimately be called a masterpiece: beautifully written_ filled with humanity and wisdom_ rich in historical detail_ authentic and evocative. Melville's spirit informs every page of her tour de force. 

Una Spenser's marriage to Captain Ahab is certainly a crucial element in the narrative of Ahab's Wife_ but the story covers vastly more territory. After a spellbinding opening scene_ the tale flashes back to Una's childhood in Kentucky; her idyllic adolescence with her aunt and uncle's family at a lighthouse near New Bedford; her adventures disguised as a cabin boy on a whaling ship; her first marriage to a fellow survivor who descends into violent madness; courtship and marriage to Ahab; life as mother and a rich captain's wife in Nantucket; involvement with Frederick Douglass; and a man who is in Nantucket researching his novel about his adventures on her ex-husband's ship."

Kelso decides to use his last morning in Moscow to check out the old man's story. But what starts as an idle inquiry in the Lenin Library soon turns into a murderous chase across nighttime Moscow and up to northern Russia--to the vast forests near the White Sea port of Archangel_ where the final secret of Josef Stalin has been hidden for almost half a century."
Bel Canto,Fiction_General Fiction,"Somewhere in South America_ at the home of the country's vice president_ a lavish birthday party is being held in honor of Mr. Hosokawa_ a powerful Japanese businessman.

It is a perfect evening -- until a band of gun-wielding terrorists breaks in through the air-conditioning vents and takes the entire party hostage. But what begins as a panicked_ life-threatening scenario slowly evolves into something quite different_ as terrorists and hostages forge unexpected bonds and people from different countries and continents become compatriots.

Without the demands of the world to shape their days_ life on the inside becomes more beautiful than anything they had ever known before. At once riveting and impassioned_ the narrative becomes a moving exploration of how people communicate when music is the only common language.

And when destiny places him alone at the helm_ Jim's options are reduced to two: sail or die_ because the terror that is relentlessly approaching at breakneck speed will not be shaken off or deterred -- nor will it rest until Hustle and Jim Leighton both lie broken and lifeless on the ocean floor."
The Portrait of Mrs. Charbuque,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Historical_North America_Nineteenth Century,"The toast of 1893 New York society_ the portraitist Piero Piambo has his pick of choice assignments. Acclaimed by his peers and his ""betters_"" he is a fixture in the city's most opulent salons_ yet he fears he has sold his soul to arrive there. But then comes a commission unlike any other -- one that will test Piambo's talents_ his will...and his sanity.

And the deeper Piambo is drawn into Mrs. Charbuque's world_ the more he begins to suspect that these terrible events_ his impossible task_ and his odd ""benefactress"" are somehow intimately connected."

Walker is a wonderful creation_ the epitome of the handsome_ hard-drinking_ hard-punching tough guy with a heart.

Tenant of Wildfell Hall,Fiction_General Fiction,Opens in the autumn of 1812_ when a mysterious woman who calls herself Helen Graham seeks refuge at the desolate moorland mansion of Wildfell Hall. Bronte's enigmatic heroine becomes the object of gossip and jealousy as neighbors learn she is escaping from an abusive marriage and living under an assumed name. A daring story that exposed the dark brutality of Victorian chauvinism_ The Tenant of Wildfell Hall was nevertheless attacked by some critics as a celebration of the same excesses it criticized.

Drawn from Anne Bronte's own experiences_ Agnes Grey depicts the harsh conditions and class snobbery that governesses were often forced to endure.(from the publisher)
Villette,Fiction_General Fiction_Women's Fiction_Feminist_Literary Fiction/classics,Arguably Bronte's most refined and deeply felt work_ Villette draws on her experiences as a student in Brussels as well as her profound loneliness following the deaths of her three siblings.

Shirley,Fiction_General Fiction_Literary Fiction/classics,"Following the tremendous popular success of Jane Eyre_ which earned her lifelong notoriety as a moral revolutionary_ Charlotte Bronte vowed to write a sweeping social chronicle that focused on ""something real and unromantic as Monday morning.""

One is the shy Caroline Helstone_ who is trapped in the oppressive atmosphere of a Yorkshire rectory and whose bare life symbolizes the plight of single women in the nineteenth century. The other is the vivacious Shirley Keeldar_ who inherits a local estate and whose wealth liberates her from convention.

The Professor,Fiction_General Fiction_Literary Fiction/classics,The Professor was the first novel that Charlotte Bronte completed. Rejected by the publisher who took on the work of her sisters in 1846 - Anne's Agnes Grey and Emily's Wuthering Heights - it remained unpublished until 1857_ two years after Charlotte Bronte's death. Like Villette_ The Professor is based on her experiences as a language student in Brussels in 1842.

Bronte's hero escapes from a humiliating clerkship in a Yorkshire mill to find work as a teacher in Belgium_ where he falls in love with an impoverished student-teacher_ who is perhaps the author's most realistic feminist heroine. The Professor endures today as both a harbinger of Bronte's later novels and a compelling read in its own right.

The Guards have only a shadow of a case against her. But Olympe - mystical and rebellious - is a woman of color_ whose chance for justice is slim. As Benjamin probes the allegation_ he is targeted by a new threat: graveyard dust sprinkled at his door_ whispering of a voodoo death curse. Now_ to save Olympe's life - and his own - Benjamin knows he must glean information wherever he can find it. For in the heavy darkness of New Orleans_ the truth is what you make it_ and justice can disappear with the night's warm breeze as easy as graveyard dust...
Sold Down the River,Fiction_Historical_North America_Nineteenth Century_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives_General,"Penetrating the murkiest corners of glittering New Orleans society_ Benjamin January brought murderers to justice in A Free Man of Color_ Fever Season_ and Graveyard Dust. Now_ in Barbara Hambly's haunting new novel_ he risks his life in a violent plantation world darker than anything in the city...

When slave owner Simon Fourchet asks Benjamin January to investigate sabotage_ arson_ and murder on his plantation_ January is reluctant to do any favors for the savage man who owned him until he was seven. But he knows too well that plantation justice means that if the true culprit is not found_ every slave on Mon Triomphe will suffer.

But it's pitch-black in the alley where free man of color Benjamin January hears a slurred whisper_ spies the flash of a knife_ and is himself wounded as he rescues Belaggio from a vicious attack. Could competition for audiences - or for Belagio's affections - provoke such violent skulduggery? Or is Shakespeares's tragic tale_ with its spectacle of a black man's passion for a white beauty_ one that some Creole citizen  or American parvenu  would do anything to keep off the stage? The soaring music will lead January into a tangle of love_ hate_ and greed more treacherous than any onstage drama_ as he must discover who is responsible... and who will Die Upon a Kiss.
Wet Grave,Fiction_Historical_North America_Nineteenth Century_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives_General,"Its 1835 and the relentless glare of the late July sun has slowed New Orleans to a standstill. When Hesione LeGros--once a corsairs jeweled mistress_ now a raddled hag--is found slashed to death in a shanty on the fringe of New Orleanss most lawless quarter_ there are few to care. But one of them is Benjamin January_ musician and teacher. He well recalls her blazing ebony beauty when she appeared_ exquisitely gowned and handy with a stiletto_ at a demimonde banquet years ago. 

Who would want to kill this woman now--Hessy_ they said_ would turn a trick for a bottle of rum--had some quarrelsome customer decided to do away with her? Or could it be one of the sexual predators who roamed the dark and seedy streets? Or--as Benjamin comes to suspect--was her killer someone she knew_ someone whose careful search of her shack suggests a cold-blooded crime? Someone whose boot left a chillingly distinctive print . . .

His inquiries at taverns_ markets_ and slave dances reveal little about Hellfire Hessy since her glory days in Barataria Bay_ once the lair of gentlemen pirates. Then the murder is swept from his mind by the delivery of a crate filled with contraband rifles--and yet another telltale boot print left by its claimant. When a murder swiftly follows_ Ben and Rose Vitrac_ the woman he loves_ fear the workings of a serpentine mind and a treacherous plot: one only they can hope to thwart in time."

But when Benjamin and Rose arrive at Hacienda Mictlán_ they encounter a murky tangle of family relations_ and more than one suspect in young Fernandos murder. 

While the evidence against Hannibal is damning_ Benjamin is certain that his consumptive_ peace-loving fellow musician isnt capable of murder. Their only allies are the dead boys half sister_ who happens to be Hannibals latest inamorata_ and the mentally unstable Castellon himself_ who awaits Mexicos holy Days of the Dead_ when he believes his slain son will himself reveal the identity of his killer.The search for the truth will lead Benjamin and Rose down a path that winds from the mazes of the capitals back streets and barrios to the legendary pyramids of Mictlán and_ finally_ to a place where spirits walk and the dead cry out for justice. But before they can lay to rest the ghosts of the past_ Benjamin and Rose will have to stop a flesh-and-blood murderer whos determined to escape the day of reckoning and add Benjamin and Rose to the swelling ranks of the dead."

"The ""M"" Word",Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives_Amateur,"With a sensibility shaped in the sixties and kids born in the seventies_ Jersey City community college professor Bel Barrett hit the big five-O in the nineties. The patronage politics of urban academia and the dreams and demands of city students threaten to burn Bel out but its hot flashes and a fancy fundraiser that really turn the heat on. Before Bel has a chance to do justice to the tempting display of calorie-laden food_ her slim and attractive boss_ college president Dr. Altagracia Garcia_ pops a few goodies_ crumples to the floor_ and is pronounced dead.
The murder is pinned on one of Bels students_ but Bel isnt buying it. The accused is a Culinary Arts major whose best grade in English was an incomplete_ but the boy is no killer. Although President Garcia had made her presence felt at the college_ shed ground her stiletto heels into a few administrative toes in the process. But most students and faculty adored her_ and finding out who wanted the assertive lady out of the way is the least Bel can do  even when it means chasing through a maze of phony clues and false leads that challenge her mid-life memory... and learning that she herself has become the target of someone majoring in murder."
Death in a Hot Flash,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives_Amateur,"Professor Bel Barrett has enough on her plate teaching English at a Jersey City community college. Between hot flashes_ she's worrying about her two grown kids and whether her significant other is becoming less significant. Yet somehow Bel lets a colleague_ Vinny Vallone--part-time Funeral Services Education teacher_ big-time undertaker--flatter her into believing that the future of feminism in the funeral business depends on her acting as a role model by teaching his class how to research and write. But before Bel actually gets into co-teaching the inner-city undertaker wannabes_ Vinny the undertaker turns into Vinny the deceased. 
There's no doubt it's murder_ and suspicion is focused on one of Bel's students_ a young reformed ex-gangster. Bel doesn't believe the born-again ex-con murdered Vinny and_ as always_ she makes it her business to right a wrong. With no shortage of suspects_ Bel sets out to catch a killer_ despite the strong possibility that her nose for news may land her in a hot spot even she can't fan her way out of."
Mood Swings to Murder,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives_Amateur,"Fifty-something New Jersey community college professor Bel Barret has had enough ""changes of life"" lately to last her a lifetime. Her daughter has cheerfully announced her pregnancy and her impending marriage in a single e-mail. Her son has come back home to find himself_ but all he's found so far is the TV remote. Even a romantic stroll covering the Hoboken waterfront with live-in love Sol can do nothing to stabilize Bel's menopausal mood swings--especially when they stumble across the corpse of a stranger in the night who turns out to be...Frank Sinatra?

Actually_ the bogus Blue Eyes was one Louie Palumbo_ a sorry imitation of the late local icon. And since Louie had been dating and two-timing one of Bel's favorite students_ the unfortunate co-ed is now the prime suspect in Palumbo's slaying. Bel's determined to go all the way to rout out the real killer. But that means plunging estrogen patch-first into the strange world of obsessive Sinatra worship--a move that could prove to be something stupid...maybe even fatal!"
Midlife Can Be Murder,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives_Amateur,"Mood swings aren't the only hormonal hotspots in Bel Barrett's midlife -- now she's having a religious identity crisis...and a dose of Jewish guilt to boot!

So when the ""accidental"" death of a close colleague leaves Ashley distraught_ Bel feels compelled to investigate the tragedy. But her good intentions land her in a wildworld of corporate espionage_ dangerous personal and professional practices_ and old-fashioned chicanery at a new internet company. When she realizes that a fatal indoor rock climbing ""mishap"" was really a murder_ Bel's suddenly snarled in a deadly web that will take a Solomon to untangle...and a Samson to survive."
Out of Hormone's Way,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives_Amateur,"Maybe it was a case of menopausal madness -- or the blatant bribe of a pound bag of M&Ms -- but fifty-something Jersey City community college prof Bel Barrett found herself agreeing to head up the Urban Kayaking Club. Now she's dragging her tush down to the banks of the Hackensack River early every Saturday morning when she could be doing something constructive ... like sleeping. But murder puts a damper on her ""natural"" enthusiasm when the battered corpse of Belinda Judd -- who didn't show up at their previous outing -- is discovered a day later. The cops' prime suspect is club president Jason_ who blatantly lied about seeing the dead girl. Jason needs Bel's help_ but it's not for this smarmy college Casanova that she's determined to get justice. It's for sweet_ shy Belinda_ who didn't have an enemy in the world ... except for the creep who killed her_ and who is now looking to sink Bel as well."
Hot and Bothered,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives_Amateur,"Things are scarier since that black day in September that shook Manhattan and the world. But across the river in Hoboken_ New Jersey_ community college professor Bel Barrett intends to live without fear_ despite her honey Sol's newborn wish that they retire and escape to somewhere remote.

So Bel turns her attentions to home renovation_ civic matters_ and to an increasingly bitter battle for scholarship money_ a contest she and three others must ultimately decide. Then one of the other judges is found dead on the mean streets of Hoboken -- a woman who lived a strange double life as academic by day and stripper by night.

Unsure whether the solution to her friend's murder lies in the hallowed halls of learning or the smoky dens of flesh and fantasy_ Bel decides to investigate both. But education and titillation could prove a most volatile mix -- and a murderer may be closer than she thinks."

When her husband died_ she should have stepped aside_ allowing her husband's son by a concubine to rule over Egypt. But Hatshepsut was still young when her husband-brother died_ and his heir was a mere child. The Temple of Amon gave the regency to her. And then Hatshepsut did the unthinkable - she took the crowns of Upper and Lower Egypt in her own name and made herself king.

Gallows View,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives_General,Former London policeman Alan Banks relocated to Yorkshire seeking some small measuer of peace.

And when an elderly woman is found brutally slain in her home_ Chief Inspector Banks wonders if the voyeur has increased the awful intensity of his criminal activities.

It is a particularly heinous slaying_ considering the esteem in which the victim_ Harry Steadman_ was held by his neighbors and colleagues -- by everyone_ it seems_ except the one person who bludgeoned the life out of the respected scholar and left him half-buried in a farmer's field.
Detective Chief Inspector Alan Banks left the violence of London behind for what he hoped would be the peaceful life of a country policeman. But the brutality of Steadman's murder only reinforces one ugly_ indisputable truth: that evil can flourish in even the most bucolic of settings. There are dangerous secrets hidden in the history of this remote Yorkshire community that have already led to one death. And Banks will have to plumb a dark and shocking local past to find his way to a killer before yesterday's sins cause more blood to be shed."

The Hanging Valley,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives_General,Visitors have been drawn to the beauty and serenity of the Yorkshire countryside. Some never leave -- like the hiker whose decomposing corpse is discovered in a wooded valley outside the tiny village of Swainshead. It is the second such homicide to plague the region in recent years_ and it is pulling investigating Detective Chief Inspector Alan Banks into a dangerous mire of dark pasts_ local power_ and private shames. Because a shocking truth and a cold-blooded killer are waiting there ... and Banks is determined to walk into the valley of death to expose them both.
Past Reason Hated,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives_General,"A picturesque Yorkshire village is dressed in its finest for the upcoming Noel. But one of its residents will not be celebrating this holiday.

And now she is dead_ clothed only in her unshared mysteries and her blood. In this season of giving and forgiving_ Banks is eager to absolve the innocent of their sins. But that must wait until the many facets of a perplexing puzzle are exposed and the dark circle of his investigation finally closesand when a killer makes the next move."
Wednesday's Child,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives_General,It was a crime of staggering inhumanity: a seven-year-old girl taken from her working class Yorkshire home by an attractive young couple posing as social workers. Detective Chief Inspector Alan Banks feels certain little Gemma Scupham is dead_ yet the motive for her kidnapping remains a mystery. No ransom is ever demanded_ nor could Gemma's tortured_ guilt-ridden mother afford to pay one. And when the body of a young man is discovered in an abandoned mine_ slain in a particularly brutal fashion_ a disturbing_ perplexing case takes an even more sinister twist -- drawing Banks into the sordid depths of an evil more terrible and terrifying than anything the seasoned investigator has ever encountered.
Dry Bones That Dream,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives_General,In the Yorkshire countryside_ middle-aged accountant and financial consultant Keith Rothwell is murdered while his wife and daughter are forced to watch. Detective Inspector Alan Banks and his assistant_ Constable Susan Gay_ are the lead investigators on the case. As Banks and Gay investigate_ they reveal the victim to have been a conservative_ quiet man virtually devoid of personality and style. But then a beautiful young musician sees Rothwell's picture in the paper and reveals that he had a secret life: as Robert Calvert_ the musician's former lover. Meanwhile_ Rothwell's financial dealings are coming into focus: he was skimming from one of his clients_ a drug-dealing Caribbean dictator_ and may have been murdered for his transgressions. The few loose ends to the case trouble Banks_ and he pursues them until he draws a surprising conclusion.
Innocent Graves,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives_General,The more Chief Inspector Alan Banks investigates the murder of a schoolgirl in a church graveyard_ the less he likes the whole sordid affair. The vicar at St. Mary's has been allegedly seeking sex from his sexton; the vicar's wife has been seeking solace in a bottle and the arms of a schoolteacher; and those in and around the church aren't keen on anybody who doesn't view matters as they do. And there happen to be a few suspects who meet that description. Banks investigates a murder and finds religious and societal affairs stickier than those in the normal mystery.
Blood at the Root,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives_General,"When the brutally beaten body of a young man is found in an ally_ Eastvale's Detective Chief Inspector Alan Banks and his colleague_ Detective Constable Susan Gay_ have no choice but to lack up the three Pakistani youths who seemingly started it all after an argument in a pub.But they're out in no time and Banks is in big trouble with the Chief for risking a racial incident with the arrest. Ordered to run the investigation from his desk and leave the legwork to others_ Banks' handes are tied and his temper is flaring.

But when disturbing facts start emerging about the victim_ Banks can't simply sit at his desk--and he soon alienates himself from both the investigation and his own department. While his twenty-year marriage crumbles around him_ he tries to make sense of a gray world grown ever more black and sinister_ as he follows a treacherous trail of hate_ greed_ and twisted philosophy that leads to the darkest pits of a man's inhumanity to man."
In a Dry Season,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives_General,Estranged from his carping wife_ and still in the doghouse with petty Chief Constable Jeremiah Riddle after his freelance investigations in Blood at the Root (1997)_ Eastvale's Chief Inspector Alan Banks doesn't expect much good news and his worst fears seem confirmed when Jimmy Riddle packs him off to Harksmere_ where a drought and an inquisitive boy have combined to reveal a 50-year-old corpse under the rotting floor of a building no longer submerged in the parched Thornfield Reservoir. There's clearly no glory to be won solving so ancient a case_ especially when the local investigating force consists of one sergeant_ Anne Cabbot_ and almost everyone who might know what happened in the abandoned village of Hobb's End is now as dead as the village itself. Starting with hints from the corpse (some fine_ unobtrusive pathological work here)_ Banks and Cabbot slowly narrow their focus to the the household of Matthew Shackleton a farm boy who went off to the war in 1941 after marrying lively land girl Gloria Stringer and of his sister Gwen. Meantime_ mystery novelist Vivian Elmsley_ hearing of the grisly find beneath the reservoir_ cowers (why?) in anticipation of Banks's knock at her own door. Crosscutting dexterously between past and present_ courtesy of Vivian's memoir of the days when the countryside was shorn of its native males and overrun by charming Yanks_ Robinson delicately reveals a web of passion and pain whose pattern still isn't complete. If the plot's outline echoes that of Reginald Hill's On Beulah Height (1998)_ the grand scale and warm compassion of Banks's tenth case vault him into Hill's select company. For all his troubles at home_ this is Banks's finest hour.
Cold is the Grave,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives_General,"In recent years_ the career of Detective Chief Inspector Alan Banks has been stalled -- and_ in fact_ very nearly destroyed -- by the petty animosities of his politically ambitious senior officer Chief Constable Jeremiah ""Jimmy"" Riddle. But when nude pictures of Riddle's runaway teenage daughter show up on a pornographic website_ he turns to Banks for help.
The trail first leads Banks to London's Soho and then to Little Venice_ where Emily Riddle is living with a dangerous gangster with ties to the world of rock music. At first refusing to go home_ Emily later turns up at Banks's hotel_ bruised and frightened and asking for his help. Soon she is back with her family in Yorkshire_ and Banks's work appears to be done.

Now there are other concerns occupying Banks's time_ thoughts_ and conscience. A major reorganization at Eastvale Regional Headquarters has brought DS Annie Cabbot back into his life_ carrying with her disturbing memories of their brief shared romance and her own painful secrets. But as they begin an investigation together into the slaying of Charlie Courage -- a low-level local felon and security guard who was executed by persons unknown for reasons unknown -- the ""closed"" Emily Riddle case is suddenly reopened in a most brutal and unexpected manner.

A gruesome murder occurs in a popular Eastvale club_ filling the national tabloids with headlines that scream of scandal_ sex_ and high-level corruption. It is a cold and savage homicide that shakes Alan Banks to his very core and leads to shocking revelations that suggest the Courage affair is somehow linked to something much closer to home. And now the grim discoveries of his unfolding investigation are leading Banks in a direction he does not wish to go: into the past and private world of his most powerful enemy_ Chief Constable Riddle."
Aftermath,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives_General,"The crime scene awaiting Acting Detective Superintendent Alan Banks is among the worst he has ever encountered. The assailant_ Terence Payne_ hovers close to death himself. And Payne's brutalized wife_ Lucy -- whose overheard screams prompted the original call -- has already been moved to a local hospital for treatment. But these sins and tragedies pale before what else has transpired in a dank basement the press will soon dub the ""House of Payne."" Now that the fiend is in custody_ the long nightmare appears over at last.

But is it? In Alan Banks's mind too many questions need to be answered before he can rest easy. How could the heinous crimes of a popular teacher like Payne have so completely escaped the notice of his peers_ his neighbors...his wife? And was fragile_ abused Lucy Payne a victim or a reluctant accomplice?

Despite the strain on his own personal life and relationships_ Banks refuses to ease up on his investigation. Buried deep in the past are shards of irony_ pity_ and horror almost too painful to bear_ and unspeakable betrayals that deformed more than one childhood. For Banks_ for his lover_ Annie Cabot -- who suspects heartless political forces are setting her up to destroy a life -- and for the beautiful consulting psychologist Dr. Jenny Fuller_ there is much more that must be unearthed in the aftermath of abomination. Because the darkness has not yet lifted_ and new casualties are mounting. And there are still monsters loose in the world..."
Close to Home,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives_General,"Detective Inspector Alan Banks has never forgiven himself for having possibly caused the disappearance and presumed death of his best friend back in the summer of 1965_ a pivotal time when both boys stood on the precipice of manhood. 

When the tragic bones are shockingly unearthed and identified near Banks's childhood home more than 35 years later_ the imagined skeleton in the detective's closet becomes all too real. Plummeted back into a past he thought he'd left behind_ Banks is drawn into an investigation that hits dangerously close to home."
Angel Station,Fiction_Science Fiction_Adventure_New Frontiers,"Ubu Roy and Beautiful Maria were orphans_ born in the depths of space_ genetically engineered to be expert star pilots - and more.  For Ubu_ the agile_ strong bossrider of the starship ""Runaway_"" could encompass all of history with his remarkable memory.

A Streetcar Named Desire,Drama and Plays_Tragedy,"With the New York production of A Streetcar Named Desire in 1947_ Tennessee Williams's reputation was established once and for all as America's leading dramatist since O'Neill.
The winner of both the Pulitzer Prize and The Drama Critics Circle Award_ Streetcar is a work of great lyric power and deep_ compassionate understanding.  Set in New Orleans_ it is one of Tennessee Williams's unsurpassed portraits of a beautiful_ sensitive woman in misplaces circumstances - Blanche DuBois_ whose life is undermined by fantasy and the memory of a tragic love - and the resentment and passion she arouses in her brutish brother-in-law_ Stanley Kowalski."
The Glass Menagerie,Drama and Plays_Tragedy,No play in the modern theatre has so captured the imagination and heart of the American public as Tennessee Williams's The Glass Menagerie.  As Williams's first popular success_ it launched the brilliant_ if somewhat controversial_ career of our pre-eminent lyric playwright.  Since its premiere in Chicago in 1944_ with the legendary Laurette Taylor in the role of Amanda_ Menagerie has been the bravura piece for great actresses from Jessica Tandy to Joanne Woodward_ and is studied and performed in classrooms and theatres around the world.

Through their girlhood years they share everythingperceptions_ judgments_ yearnings_ secrets_ even crimeuntil Sula gets out_ out of the Bottom_ the hilltop neighborhood where beneath the sporting life of the men hanging around the place in headrags and soft felt hats there hides a fierce resentment at failed crops_ lost jobs_ thieving insurance men_ bug-ridden flour...at the invisible line that cannot be overstepped.
Sula leaps it and roams the cities of America for ten years. Then she returns to the town_ to her friend. But Nel is a wife now_ settled with her man and her three children. She belongs. She accommodates to the Bottom_ where you avoid the hand of God by getting in it_ by staying upright_ helping out at church suppers_ asking after folkswhere you deal with evil by surviving it.
Not Sula. As willing to feel pain as to give pain_ she can never accommodate. Nel can't understand her any more_ and the others never did. Sula scares them. Mention her now_ and they recall that she put her grandma in an old folks' home (the old lady who let a train take her leg for the insurance)...that a child drowned in the river years ago...that there was a plague of robins when she first returned...
In clear_ dark_ resonant language_ Toni Morrison brilliantly evokes not only a bond between two lives_ but the harsh_ loveless_ ultimately mad world in which that bond is destroyed_ the world of the Bottom and its people_ through forty years_ up to the time of their bewildered realization that even more than they feared Sula_ their pariah_ they needed her."

The Far Side of the Stars,Fiction_Science Fiction_Adventure_Militaristic,"While the Republic of Cinnabar is at peace with the Alliance_ warriors like Lt. Daniel Leary and Signals Officer Adele Mundy must find other worklike escorting a pair of wealthy nobles on an expedition to the back of beyond! The Princess Cecile_ the corvette in which they carved their reputations in letters of fire_ has been sold as a private yacht_ but she still has her guns_ her missiles_ and her veteran crew. Daniel and Adele will need all of those things as they face winged dragons_ an Alliance auxiliary cruiser_ jealous lovers_ and a mysterious oracle which really does foresee the future. That won't be enough_ though_ when they penetrate a secret Alliance base and find a hostile fleet ready for a war that will sweep Cinnabar out of a strategically crucial arm of the galaxy. Preventing that will involve skill_ courage_ and more luck than a sane man could even pray for; and it will require a space battle on a scale that a tiny corvette like the Princess Cecile has no business being involved in.  But she'll be in the middle of it anyway_ because Daniel_ Adele_ and their Cinnabar crew would never turn their backs on a fight!

A Coney Island of the Mind,Poetry_Verse,The title of this book is taken from Henry Miller's Into the Night Life and expresses the way Lawrence Ferlinghetti felt about these poems when he wrote them during a short period in the 1950's - as if they were_ taken together_ a kind of Coney Island of the mind_ a kind of circus of the soul.

The author also thinks of it as a kind of caustic critique of modern poetry_ including confrontations with or parodies of major figures in the literary avant-garde before the arrival of the Beat generation_ notably Pound and Eliot_ Beckett and Joyce."
Her,Fiction_General Fiction_Bohemians & Expatriates,'A surreal semi-autobiographical blackbook record of a semi-mad period of my life_ in that mindless_ timeless state most romantics pass through_ confusing flesh madonnas with spiritual ones.'

Routines,Drama and Plays_Experimental & Absurd,"Ferlinghetti's very short experimental plays. In this collection Ferlinghetti takes a revolutionary look at modern theater and explores the area between old-style drama and spontaneous improvisation by supplying a blueprint for dramatic actionan outline from which director and actors may create and interpret freely. In one called '""Our Little Trip"" two men in conservative suits wind themselves in and out of a long bandage while a questioner circles them seeking Meaning. ""Servants of the People"" puts on political podium hogs in torrents of cliches. ""Bearded Lady 'Dies'"" features the Second Coming all decked out for newspaper coverage."
The Secret Meaning of Things,Poetry_Verse,These poems show a progressive continuity and clarity of perception that apprehends both the hard reality and luminous irreality in everyday phenomena.
San Francisco Poems,Poetry_Verse,Here are all of Ferlinghetti's poems set in the city he has lived in for over half a century. He brings alive_ with wit and lyricism_ scenes of city life: a Giants baseball game_ the Green Street Marching Mortuary Band_ bohemian North Beach_ Golden Gate Park_ yachts on the Bay_ and more. Also included are historic photographs_ scattered prose pieces_ and the text of his mischievous inaugural address with his vision of the city's history as a poetic center and suggestions for keeping it that way.

Headlong,Fiction_General Fiction,Invited to dinner by the boorish local landowner_ Martin Clay_ an easily distracted philosopher_ and his scrupulous art-historian wife find themselves enlisted to assess the value of three dusty paintings moldering in the freezer breakfast room. But blocking the soot from the chimney is nothing less - Martin believes - than one of the world's lost treasures_ camouflaged by misattribution and the grime of centuries. Martin embarks on an obsessive quest to prove his hunch_ win over his wife_ separate the painting from its owner_ and resolve one of the great mysteries of European art.
Beautiful False Things: Poems,Poetry_Verse,"This tenth collection of Irving Feldman's poems extends what readers and critics have long recognized as a body of work singular in its lyric_ visionary_ even prophetic intensity; its extravagant wit; its powerful storytelling; and its variety of voices and range of feeling - playful_ tender_ ardent_ biting_ enthralled. Here_ among the major poems of Beautiful False Things_ the stand-up comic Larry Sunrise of ""Funny Bones"" duels with death in Florida; in ""Oedipus Host_"" Oedipus arrives from his millennia-long trek to host a TV talk show; and the plucky feminist heroine of ""Heavenly Muse"" visits yet another barely worthy male poet. In the tragicomic title poem_ ""translation"" comes to stand for the dilemmas of expression in a culture that sucks up language and spews it back."
"Counting Myself Lucky: Selected Poems, 1963-1992",Poetry_Verse,""
The Shine Poems,Poetry_Verse,Shine is an African American folk character who emerged after World War I in toasts_ blues_ folk poetry_ and children's rhymes. In his new book of poems_ Calvin Forbes reinvents Shine_ giving him a girlfriend_ Glow_ and a child_ Shade. He renders the figure more melancholy and adds traces of the surreal and slapstick - accessories 'typical of the folk dibbling and dabbling as the tradition is passed along'.  While only the last quarter of The Shine Poems concern Shine_ all of the poems reflect a similar sensibility. They share the narrative threads of family relationships and personal and social history while they test the full possibilities of colloquial language and speech rhythms in verse.
The Angel of History,Poetry_Verse,"Placed in the context of twentieth-century moral disaster - war_ genocide_ the Holocaust_ the atomic bomb - Forche's third collection of poems is a meditation on memory_ specifically on how memory survives the unimaginable. The poems reflect the effects of such experience: the lines_ and often the images within them_ are fragmented_ discordant. But read together_ these lines become a haunting mosaic of grief_ evoking the necessary accommodations human beings make to survive what is unsurvivable. These are personal poems_ poems startling in their honesty and humility_ poems that bear witness rather than explain or resolve. Carolyn Forche describes her book in a note to the reader: ""The Angel of History is not about experiences. It is for me the opening of a wound_ the muffling and silence of a decade_ and it is also a gathering of utterances that have lifted away from the earth and wrapped it in a weather of risen words. These utterances issue from my own encounter with the events of this century but do not represent 'it.' The first-person_ free-verse_ lyric-narrative poem of my earlier years has given way to a work which has desired its own bodying forth: polyphonic_ broken_ haunted_ and in ruins_ with no possibility of restoration."" An ambitious and compelling collection_ The Angel of History may also be groundbreaking. As poets have always done_ Forche attempts to give voice to the unutterable_ using language to keep memory alive_ relive history_ make tracks in an empty field_ and link the past with the future."
The Blue Hour: Poems,Poetry_Verse,The longest poem_ 'On Earth_' is a transcription of mind passing from life to death_ in the form of an abecedary_ modeled on ancient gnostic hymns. Other poems in the book_ especially 'Nocturne' and 'Blue Hour_' are lyric recoveries of the act of remembering_ though the objects of memory seem to us vivid and irretrievable_ the rage to summon and cling at once fierce and distracted.
The Country Between Us,Poetry_Verse,""
Gathering the Tribes,Poetry_Verse,The language and images of Carolyn Forche's poetry are so closely bound to the natural cycles of the seasons_ of generations_ of the body's functioning_ that it is surprising to realize how many of her poems deal with uprootedness - hasty emigrations from Czechoslovakia and Kiev_ the loss of grandparents and other elders_ people leaving and being sent away.

Pursuit: Poems,Poetry_Verse,"Erica Funkhouser's fourth book is full of animal and human pursuits: a leaf-cutting bee careens from branch to branch_ looking for the right place to nest; a frustrated farmer stalks her garden's invisible predator; a young woman insists on walking the length of a canyon whose river terrifies her; a dying man tries to avoid death long enough to die gracefully. Whether driven by elemental need or sublime desire_ the inhabitants of these poems are actively engaged in seeking of every kind -- physical_ intellectual_ and spiritual. Their very effort animates them. Pursuit is also devoted to the details of living -- what we build_ how we eat_ our solitary and communal habits_ our obsessions_ how we amuse ourselves_ how we find and endure love_ how we survive. In ""Mydas Fly_"" the narrator remarks of an insect sucking nectar_ ""I have been hunting for an act / this skillful_ this unapologetic.""(from the publisher)"
Sure Shot and Other Poems,Poetry_Verse,The opening section of Erica Funkhouser's first book of poems since Natural Affinities comprises twenty-six lyric poems of a surpassing tenderness_ poems that explore a contemporary woman's response to elemental events and the loves and losses that make up the fabric of our human frailty. Refusing to observe nature complacently_ she witnesses the stillbirth of a calf and deconstructs the wild diet of owls_ bringing an equally tough precision and richness of emotion to family life and the relations of friends and lovers. The inventiveness and humor of these poems_ under firm formal control yet warm in their unexpected inner motions_ is rare indeed in contemporary poetry. The second part of Sure Shot consists of three poetic monologues that reconsider the history and ideals of America through the eyes of nineteenth-century women - Sacagawea_ the Shoshone squaw who guided Lewis and Clark up the Missouri River and across the Rockies to reach the Pacific; Louisa May Alcott during her self-sacrificial girlhood in the transcendental colony of Fruitlands in Massachusetts; and Annie Oakley_ the renowned sharpshooter who traveled around the world with Buffalo Bill Cody's Wild West Show. These keenly dramatic poems display voices and textures that explore both the inner worlds of these three extraordinary women_ and their richly layered responses to some of the central events of the century in which they lived. The light in Funkhouser's poems is generous but exacting: she illuminates what we have never noticed before.

The Preacher and the Slave,Fiction_Historical_North America,"A remarkable portrait of one of American labor's most enduring legends.
Blending fact with fiction_ Wallace Stegner retells the story of Joe Hill - the Wobbly bard who became the stuff of legend when_ in 1915_ he was executed for the alleged murder of a Salt Lake City businessman.

Joe Hill is full-bodied portrait of both the man and the myth: from his entrance into the short-lived Industral Workers of the World union_ the most militant organization in the history of American labor_ to his trial_ imprisonment_ and final martyrdom - his last words to the I.W.W._ ""Don't waste time mourning.

The Castle of Otranto,Fiction_Fantasy_Dark Fantasy_Horror_The occult and Supernatural_Horace  Walpole_William  Beckford_Samuel  Johnson_Mary  Shelley,"First published pseudonymously in 1764_ ""The Castle of Otranto"" purported to be a translation of an Italian story of the time of the crusades. In it Walpole attempted_ as he declared in the Preface to the second edition_ ""to blend the two kinds of romance: the ancient and the modern"". He gives us a series of catastrophes_ ghostly interventions_ revelations of identity_ and exciting contests. Crammed with invention_ entertainment_ terror_ and pathos_ the novel was an immediate success and Walpole's own favourite among his numerous works. His friend_ the poet Thomas Gray_ wrote that he and his family_ having read Otranto_ were now ""afraid to go to bed o'nights"".
On the day of his wedding_ Conrad_ heir to the house of Otranto_ is killed in mysterious circumstances. Fearing the end of his dynasty_ his father_ Manfred_ determines to marry Conrad's betrothed_ Isabella_ until a series of supernatural events stands in his way....
Set in the time of the crusades_ The Castle of Otranto established the Gothic as a literary form in England. With its compelling blend of psychological realism and supernatural terror_ guilty secrets and unlawful desires_ it has influenced a literary tradition stretching from Ann Radcliffe and Bram Stoker to Daphne Du Maurier and Stephen King."
The Mysteries of Udolpho,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Suspense_Romance_Romantic-Suspense_Gothic,"If beautiful_ orphaned Emily St. Aubert is to resist the predatory demands of her new guardian_ the inscrutable Signor Montoni_ she must quell the superstitious imaginings that pervade her mind. Within the sombre walls of Montoni's medieval castle the boundaries of real and imagined terrors are blurred as Emily is drawn into a Gothic web of mystery and intrigue which threaten her not only with the loss of inheritance but also identity.
This is perhaps the most famous Gothic novel from the 18th-century. It was the object of Jane Austin's satire in ""Northanger Abbey""_ but had made Mrs Radcliffe famous as the great enchanter and one of the most popular female novelists of her day. It is the novel that set the tone for horror fiction_ with its decayed castles_ trap doors and ghostly portents."
The Romance of the Forest,Fiction_General Fiction_Literary Fiction/classics,"Set in a Roman Catholic Europe of violent passions and extreme oppression_ the novel follows the fate of its heroine Adeline_ who is mysteriously placed under the protection of a family fleeing Paris for debt. They take refuge in a ruined abbey in south-eastern France_ where sinister relics of the past - a skeleton_ a manuscript_ and a rusty dagger - are discovered in concealed rooms. Adeline finds herself at the mercy of the abbey's proprietor_ a libidinous Marquis whose attentions finally force her to contemplate escape to distant regions.
Rich in allusions to aesthetic theory and to travel literature_ The Romance of the Forest is also concerned with current philosophical debate and examines systems of thought central to the intellectual life of late eighteenth-century Europe.(from the publisher)"
A Sicilian Romance,Fiction_General Fiction_Literary Fiction/classics,"In A Sicilian Romance Radcliffe began to forge the unique mixture of the psychology of terror and poetic description that would make her the great exemplar of the Gothic novel_ and the idol of the Romantics.
This early novel explores the cavernous landscapes and labyrinthine passages of Sicily's castles and covents to reveal the shameful secrets of its all-powerful aristocracy. Julia and Emilia Mazzini live secluded in an ancient mansion near the Straits of Messina. After their father's return to the island a neglected part of the house is haunted by a series of mysterious sights and sounds. The origin of these hauntings is only discovered after a series of breathless pursuits through dreamlike pastoral landscapes. When revelation finally comes_ it forces the heroines to challenge the united forces of religious and patriarchal authority."
The Castles of Athlin and Dunbayne: A Highland Story,Fiction_Historical_European_Medieval,The Castles of Athlin and Dunbayne marked the arrival of a unique talent. It was Ann Radcliffe's first attempt at fiction_ and its feuds_ cases of mistaken identity_ and background of castles and the `sublime' landscape pointed the way forward to the Gothic fantasies of her later years. Set in the Middle Ages against the melancholy beauty of mountains and rugged coasts of the Scottish Highlands_ the novel describes the internecine feuds of the warring clan chieftains of Athlin and Dunbayne. Low-born clansman Alleyn pursues his quest for love and honour_ helping to rescue Osbert of Athlin and falling in love with Osbert's sister Mary. Breakneck pursuits alternate with scenes of passionate feeling_ and the castle itself_ in all its romantic sublimity_ becomes the true focal point of the novel.
The Italian,Fiction_General Fiction_Literary Fiction/classics,First published in 1797_ The Italian is one of the finest examples of Gothic romance. The fast-paced narrative centres on Ann Radcliffe's most brilliant creation_ the sinister monk Schedoni_ whose past is shrouded in mystery. From the opening chapters the reader is ushered into a shadowy world_ in which crime and religion intermingle. Leagued against Ellena Rosalba and Vincentio di Vivaldi's union are the proud and ambitious Marchese di Vivaldi and her confessor Father Schedoni. Supernatural forces seem at work_ but it is to the Holy Inquisition that the ill-omened lovers eventually fall prey.
Utopia,Fiction_Science Fiction_Political_Dystopia/Utopia,First published in 1516_ Thomas More's Utopia is one of the most important works of European humanism. Through the voice of the mysterious traveler Raphael Hythloday_ More describes a pagan_ communist city-state governed by reason. Addressing such issues as religious pluralism_ women's rights_ state-sponsored education_ colonialism_ and justified warfare_ Utopia seems remarkably contemporary nearly five centuries after it was written_ and it remains a foundational text in philosophy and political theory.
The Well at the World's End,"Fiction_Fantasy_Saga, Myth, and Legend",First published in 1896_ this book describes a long journey through a magical landscape_ a geographical as well as spiritual quest. In the land of Upmeads King Peter's sons thrist for adventure. At last the king agrees that all but Ralph_ the youngest_ may go forth. But the next day Ralph secretly makes his way to Wulstead.

News from Nowhere,Fiction_Science Fiction_Political_Dystopia/Utopia,Written in 1890_ at the close of William Morris's most intense period of political activism_ News from Nowhere is a compelling articulation of his mature views on art_ work_ community_ family_ and the nature and structure of the ideal society.

The early sixties_ a time of optimism infused with the excitement of the space race and overshadowed by the menace of the Cold war_ is filtered through the rich imagination of a child as Madeleine draws us into her world. But the base is host to some intriguing inhabitants_ including the unconventional Froehlich family_ and the odd Mr. March_ whose power over the children is a secret burden that they carry. Then tragedy strikes_ and a very local murder intersects with global forces_ binding the participants for life.

The Namesake,Fiction_General Fiction_Ethnic And Multicultural_Immigrant_Literary Fiction/classics,"In The Namesake_ Lahiri enriches the themes that made her collection an international bestseller: the immigrant experience_ the clash of cultures_ the conflicts of assimilation_ and_ most poignantly_ the tangled ties between generations. Here again Lahiri displays her deft touch for the perfect detail -- the fleeting moment_ the turn of phrase -- that opens whole worlds of emotion. The Namesake takes the Ganguli family from their tradition-bound life in Calcutta through their fraught transformation into Americans. On the heels of their arranged marriage_ Ashoke and Ashima Ganguli settle together in Cambridge_ Massachusetts.
An engineer by training_ Ashoke adapts far less warily than his wife_ who resists all things American and pines for her family. When their son is born_ the task of naming him betrays the vexed results of bringing old ways to the new world. Named for a Russian writer by his Indian parents in memory of a catastrophe years before_ Gogol Ganguli knows only that he suffers the burden of his heritage as well as his odd_ antic name. Lahiri brings great empathy to Gogol as he stumbles along a first-generation path strewn with conflicting loyalties_ comic detours_ and wrenching love affairs. With penetrating insight_ she reveals not only the defining power of the names and expectations bestowed upon us by our parents_ but also the means by which we slowly_ sometimes painfully_ come to define ourselves."
Interpreter of Maladies,Fiction_General Fiction_Ethnic And Multicultural_Immigrant_Jhumpa  Lahiri,"The nine stories in this stunning debut collection unerringly chart the emotional journeys of characters seeking love beyond the barriers of nations and generations.

With accomplished precision and gentle eloquence_ Lahiri traces the crosscurrents set in motion when immigrants_ expatriates_ and their children arrive_ quite literally_ at a cultural divide. A blackout forces a young Indian American couple to make confessions that unravel their tattered domestic peace. An Indian American girl recognizes her cultural identity during a Halloween celebration while the Pakistani civil war rages on television in the background. A latchkey kid with a single working mother finds affinity with a woman from Calcutta who_ among other things_ is struggling to learn to drive. In the title story_ an interpreter guides an American family through the India of their ancestors and hears an astonishing confession.

Imbued with the sensual details of Indian culture_ these stories speak with passion and wisdom to everyone who has ever felt like a foreigner. Like the interpreter of the title story_ Lahiri translates between the strict traditions of her ancestors and a baffling new world.

More than just a fanciful novel_ Looking Backward was_ in effect_ Bellamy's blueprint for a socialist-type state_ conceived in response to the problems of the Gilded Age brought on in part by the pace of late-nineteenth-century industrialization. The novel had an enormous impact at the time of its publication_ setting in motion a wave of reform activity and creating a vogue for utopian novels that continued over the next three decades.
Ragtime,Fiction_Historical_North America_Other,"Published in 1975_ Ragtime changed our very concept of what a novel could be. An extraordinary tapestry_ Ragtime captures the spirit of America in the era between the turn of the century and the First World War.

The story opens in 1906 in New Rochelle_ New York_ at the home of an affluent American family.  One lazy Sunday afternoon_ the famous escape artist Harry Houdini swerves his car into a telephone pole outside their house. And almost magically_ the line between fantasy and historical fact_ between real and imaginary characters_ disappears. Henry Ford_ Emma Goldman_ J. P. Morgan_ Evelyn Nesbit_ Sigmund Freud_ and Emiliano Zapata slip in and out of the tale_ crossing paths with Doctorow's imagined family and other fictional characters_ including an immigrant peddler and a ragtime musician from Harlem whose insistence on a point of justice drives him to revolutionary violence."
Book of Daniel,"Fiction_General Fiction_Midlife Crises, Journeys Of Discovery_Troubled Lives",As Cold War hysteria inflames America_ FBI agents knock on the Bronx apartment door of a Communist man and his wife. After a highly controversial trial_ the couple go to the electric chair for treason despite worldwide protests. Decades later their son_ Daniel_ grown to young manhood_ tries to make sense of their lives and deaths  and their legacy to him. Like millions of other Americans_ he is attempting to reconcile an America based on the highest human ideals with the tragedy of his parents. This is the framework for E.L. Doctorow's dazzling masterpiece_ as he fictionalizes an actual social and political drama to create an intensely moving_ searching and illuminating tale of two decades_ two generations_ and a troubled legacy of passion and purpose_ martyrdom and meaning.
City of God,Fiction_General Fiction,In his workbook_ a New York City novelist records the contents of his teeming brain--sketches for stories_ accounts of his love affairs_ riffs on the meanings of popular songs_ ideas for movies_ obsessions with cosmic processes. He is a virtual repository of the predominant ideas and historical disasters of the age. But now he has found a story he thinks may be-come his next novel: The large brass cross that hung behind the altar of St. Timothy's_ a run-down Episco-pal church in lower Manhattan_ has disappeared...and even more mysteriously reappeared on the roof of the Synagogue for Evolutionary Judaism_ on the Upper West Side.

Three radically different novels (earth subsumed by the evolutionary step of the hive culture in man; a far future earth empire battling for survival against impossibly superior alien life; and a look at the moral conflict existing within a utopia millions of years in the future) will be linked by Baxter's uniquely far reaching SF ideas and a future that allows for the manipulation of the past.

Then_ at fifteen_ Christophers carefully constructed world falls apart when he finds his neighbors dog_ Wellington_ impaled on a garden fork_ and he is initially blamed for the killing.

Windale_ Massachusetts_ is a proud old town that embraces its colonial heritage -- including the legend of a dark witches' coven dating back three hundred years.

On a crisp autumn night_ Wendy ventures into the woods to perform a harmless channeling ritual -- but unwittingly opens the floodgates to terrifying forces that have_ until then_ lived only in their dreams. The coven that arises is horrifying beyond imagination: a breed of demonic creature with the power to shatter an unsuspecting town."

Once there_ the astonished Dammy is treated for his wounds by Xorialle_ who turns out to be an observer for Consensus -- an intergalactic organization monitoring the progress of developing planets -- in the hope that one day they may have advanced sufficiently to take their rightful place in the galactic community ... or to be subjugated and stripped of their wealth.

In the process_ Dammy discovers the awesome power of the human intellect and masters virtually every human intellectual and physical skill.

But leagued against them in their fight were the entire forces of both the Wizards and the Slavers guilds.  And_ in this world where a wrong step or a twisted spell could transform friend into foe_ how could Karl and his band survive long enough to fulfill their pledge?"
The Argonaut Affair,Fiction_Science Fiction_World Versions_Time Travel_Adventure_Militaristic,"A creature out of Greek myth appears in the 27th century -- proving that something is seriously wrong down the timeline!  The Temporal Intelligence Agency fear an oncoming disaster of staggering propoertions.  Their only hope: the Time Commandos.

Delaney_ Cross_ and their new partner Steiger clock back to the age of gods_ monsters and heroes -- into the heart of an epic quest.  Lost in a legendary time and place_ the future of two universes in their hands!"
Battle for the Planet of the Apes,Fiction_Science Fiction_Planets & Societies_Anthropology/sociology,"The City of the Apes
It was a quiet_ peaceful city.
It was a city ruled by apes and served by men.
It was a city unaware of an angry band of vicious gorillas anxious to revolt and an insane cadre of mutated humans hungry to kill.
It was a city on the brink of an horrendous destruction that had happened once -- and was suddenly_ inexorably_ happening again..."
Pembroke,Fiction_General Fiction,Pembroke begins with a heated political argument between Barney Thayer and Cephas Barnard_ the father of Barney's betrothed_ Charlotte Barnard. The angry Cephas throws his prospective son-in-law out of the house and_ because of his immense pride_ Barney refuses to apologize_ even though it means he cannot marry Charlotte. The Thayers and Barnards become locked in a clash of wills_ and the broken engagement reverberates throughout the village_ ultimately affecting the relationships of two other couples in the town.  In sharp contrast to the romantic literary tradition_ Pembroke vividly depicts characters doomed to inherit the unhappiness of their ancestors. This dramatic and realistic portrayal of rural nineteenth-century New England life and Puritan ethos will reintroduce modern readers to a significant regionalist woman writer.
A New England Nun and Other Stories,Fiction_General Fiction_Mary E. Wilkins  Freeman,"Considered a ""regionalist"" writer_ like Kate Chopin and fellow New Englander Sarah Orne Jewett_ Mary E. Wilkins Freeman spent almost half a century living in New England. A prolific and renowned writer_ she had to deal with a new aspect of popularity: celebrity.
This collection shows Freeman's many modes -- romantic_ gothic_ and psychologically symbolic -- as well as her use of pathos and sentimentality_ dry reserve_ and humor_ satire_ and irony. These last are most vividly expressed in The Jamesons_ sketches of village life published here for the first time since the turn of the century. Other stories center on questions of women's integrity_ courage_ and_ often_ privation; explore cultural constructions of masculinity; and dramatize the interconnection of rural New England with modern culture and commerce.

Uncollected Stories of Mary Wilkins Freeman,Fiction_General Fiction,"Few who appreciate the heritage of the short story would question Mary Wilkins Freeman's important position in turn-of-the-century American fiction or her major contributions to the development of the short story form. Freeman (1852-1930)_ one of the first women elected to the National Institute of Arts and Letters (1927)_ was a regional writer who excelled in the careful delineation of local characters and customs and in exact transcription of indigenous dialect. She also is noted for her contribution to modern psychological literature. This volume brings together for the first time twenty of the best of her ""lost"" tales. It contributes to the growing reevaluation of this exceptional author of such often anthologized stories as ""The 'Revolt' of Mother"" and ""A New England Nun."" The stories in this volume are chronologically arranged. They reveal both familiar and new terrain. Freeman once again delves into the inner lives of New England women. Yet_ unlike many of her well-known stories_ in these there are new moods and experiments. Four stories involve male protagonists. Three are mystery stories. Three are tales of women artists. Two illustrate Freeman's attempt in her later fiction to incorporate ""modern"" themes. A prolific writer_ Freeman published nearly two-hundred-fifty short stories during her lifetime. Almost a hundred of those stories_ however_ were not collected. For more than half a century they have remained virtually inaccessible. This volume brings together twenty of the best of Freeman's uncollected stories from such magazines as Century_ Collier's_ Harper's Monthly_ Good Housekeeping_ The Golden Book_ Woman's Home Companion_ Independent_ and Frank Leslie's Popular Monthly. This collection restores significant works to the treasury of American literature.

Unfinished Tales,Fiction_Fantasy_Secondary Worlds_Epic,"Edited_ with maps and commentary_ by Christopher Tolkien.

Unfinished Tales is a collection of narratives ranging in time from the Elder Days of Middle-earth to the end of the War of the Ring_ and further relates events as told in The Silmarillion and The Lord of the Rings. The book concentrates on the lands of Middle-earth and comprises Gandalf's lively account of how he came to send the Dwarves to the celebrated party at Bag-End_ the story of the emergence of the sea-god Ulmo before the eyes of Tuor on the coast of Beleriand_ and an exact description of the military organization of the Riders of Rohan and the journey of the Black Riders during the hunt for the Ring. Unfinished Tales also contains the only surviving story about the long ages of Numenor before its downfall_ and all that is known about the Five Wizards sent to Middle-earth as emissaries of the Valar_ about the Seeing Stones known as the Palantiri_ and about the legend of Amroth. Unfinished Tales is avowedly for those who_ to the contrary_ have not yet sufficiently explored Middle-earth_ its languages_ its legends_ it politics_ and its kings."
Science Fiction of the Fifties,Fiction_Science Fiction_Mark  Clifton_Theodore  Sturgeon,"The works of several masters of the genre are brought together here in a diversified and dynamic collection of classic stories that not only raise science fiction to new standards of style and character_ but also offer brilliant insights into a decade of optimism and disillusionment.
The Fifties were a decade of fear and promise_ of witch hunts and phenomenal technological growth.  Turning both a piercing critical eye and an entertaining sense of humor and hope toward those years_ these stories tell of the fantastic dreams of yesterday and offer prophetic visions of tomorrow.

"A Barnstormer in Oz, or A Rationalization and Extrapolation of The Split-Level Continuum",Fiction_Fantasy_Contemporary_Alternate and Parallel Worlds,"Hank had a feeling he wasn't in Kansas anymore...
Hank Stover was one of two people in the world who knew that Oz really existed_ but he never expected to go there.  He never expected his plane would be forced down by a green cloud that April day in 1923.  Nor that he would meet the witch who had befriended his mother.  Nor that she would be so beautiful..."
They Walked Like Men,Fiction_Science Fiction_Alien Beings_Alien Invasion & Post-occupation,"I stood in the darkness and felt the terror closing in.  And when I tried to put a finger on the terror_ there was nothing there.  For it wasn't terrible; it was comic -- a trap set outside a door_ a pack of bowling balls trundling sedately down a country lane.  It was the stuff cartoons are made of.  It was something that was too ridiculous to believe.  It was something that would send you off into helpless guffaws even as it killed you.
If it meant to kill.
And that was the question_ certainly.
Was it meant to kill?
Parker Graves_ a newspaperman_ comes home one night to discover that a trap has been laid outside his apartment door. To his horror_ the trap is transformed into a bowling ball and runs away.  The entire city soon becomes a scene of strange happenings -- buildings are bought up at a fantastic rate_ leases aren't renewed_ established businesses are closed_ and people can't find places to live.
A true newspaperman_ Parker investigates the situation_ and after many adventures -- some hair-raising_ some humorous -- discovers the reasons for these bizarre events."
Our Mutual Friend,Fiction_General Fiction,Our Mutual Friend_ Dickens' last novel_ gives one of his most comprehensive and penetrating accounts of Victorian society.  Its vision of a culture stifled by materialistic values emerges not just through its central narratives_ but through its apparently incidental characters and scenes.  The chief of its several plots centres on John Harmon who returns to England as his father's heir.  He is believed drowned under suspicious circumstances -- a situation convenient to his wish for anonymity until he can evaluate Bella Wilfer whom he must marry to secure his inheritance.  The story is filled with colourful characters and incidents -- the faded aristocrats and parvenus gathered at the Veneering's dinner table_ Betty Higden and her terror of the workhouse and the greedy plottings of Silas Wegg.
The Beast,Fiction_Science Fiction_Technology,"As with many of A.E. van Vogt's stories_ The Beast begins with a deceptive simplicity -- for van Vogt science fiction_ that is.  Jim Pendrake_ former strong man in the Air Force_ now back from the China War of 1970 (minus his strong right arm)_ is vegetating his life away in seclusion when_ during one of his lonely horseback rides_ he finds an engine of advanced design.
How advanced the design was_ even those who had lost the engine did not realize.  But when they took it away from him_ Pendrake was stirred out of his apathy_ and began an investigation that led_ first of all_ to his sudden discovery that his lost right arm was growing back.
But that's only the beginning of a story that ranges from Pendrake's strange imprisonment by a secret organization of idealists_ who wish to spare the planets the turmoil of man's madness_ to a hidden moon colony ruled by a brutal_ super-intelligent Neanderthal_ who is a million years old ... and so to a typically van Vogtian climax_ in which the reader is a participant in vast events which somehow incredibly come to a satisfactory -- and credible -- solution."
The Tale of Custard the Dragon,Poetry_Humorous,In this humorous poem_ Custard the cowardly dragon saves the day when a pirate threatens Belinda and her pet animals
Magnificat: Poems,Poetry_Verse_Religious And Inspirational,"Magnificat is less a collection of individual poems than it is a dramatic narrative composed along the single centering line of a voice that is intimate and conversational_ warm and humorous - and yet also capable of a breathtaking level of passion. Many of the poems center on a man_ a contemporary of the poet whom she knew and fell in love with when they were university students_ but who has since become a Benedictine monk. In contemplating what her friend's spiritual life means to him_ Waniek embarks on a spiritual quest of her own. The section called Plain Songs contains poems in which Waniek reflects on the small ways in which her life is blessed_ even down to the joy of receiving an unexpected letter from a long-lost friend. A section of subtle_ humorous poems modeled after the ancient Sayings of the Desert Fathers reveals the pithy wisdom of a monk Waniek calls Abba Jacob. Here is Abba Jacob's response when asked to confirm that a series of unlikely occurrences were miraculous:. Big deal_ said Abba Jacob. Miracles happen all the time. We're here_ aren't we? Miraculous may be the word readers will choose to describe Magnificat. It is at once a spiritual book about human love and a human book about spiritual love.

The Fields of Praise: New and Selected Poems,Poetry_Verse,"In The Fields of Praise_ Marilyn Nelson claims as subjects the life of the spirit_ the vicissitudes of love_ and the African American experience and arranges them as white pebbles marking our common journey toward a ""monstrous love / that wants to make the world right."" Nelson is a poet of stunning power_ able to bring alive the most rarified and subtle of experiences. A slave destined to become a minister preaches sermons of heartrending eloquence and wisdom to a mule. An old woman scrubbing over a washtub receives a personal revelation of what Emancipation means: ""So this is freedom: the peace of hours like these."" Memories of the heroism of the Tuskegee Airmen in the face of aerial combat abroad and virulent racism at home bring a speaker to the sudden awareness of herself as the daughter ""of a thousand proud fathers."""

The Six-Cornered Snowflake and Other Poems,Poetry,As a preeminent modernist poet and translator of the classics_ John Frederick Nims's work is an elegant fusion of contemporary sensibility with formalist experimentation.
The Descent of Alette,Poetry_Epic and Narrative Poetry,"In The Descent of Alette_ Alice Notley presents a feminist epic_ a bold journey into the deeper realms. Alette_ the narrator_ finds herself underground_ deep beneath the city_ where spirits and people ride endlessly on subways_ not allowed to live in the world above. Traveling deeper and deeper_ she is on a journey of continual transformation_ encountering a series of figures and undergoing fragmentations and metamorphoses as she seeks to confront the Tyrant and heal the world. Using a new measure_ with rhythmic units indicated by quotation marks_ Notley has created a ""spoken"" text_ a rich and mesmerizing work of imagination_ mystery_ and power."
Disobedience,Poetry,Structured as a long series of interconnected poems in which one of the main elements is an ongoing dialogue with a seedy detective_ Disobedience sets out to explore the visible as well as the unconscious. These poems_ composed during a fifteen-month period_ also deal with being a woman in France_ with turning fifty_ and with being a poet_ and thus seemingly despised or at least ignored.
Mysteries of Small Houses,Poetry,"Alice Notley vividly reconstructs the mysteries_ longings_ and emotions of her past in this brilliant new collection of poems that charts her growth from young girl to young woman to accomplished artist. In this volume_ memories of her childhood in the California desert spring to life through evocative renderings of the American landscape_ circa 1950. Likewise_ her coming of age as a poet in the turbulent sixties is evoked through the era's angry_ creative energy. As she looks backward with the perspective that time and age allows_ Notley ably captures the immediacy of youth's passion while offering her own dry-eyed interpretations of the events of a life lived close to the bone. Like the colorful collages she assembles from paper and other found materials_ Notley erects structures of image and feeling to house the memories that swirl around her in the present. In their feverish_ intelligent renderings of moments both precise and ephemeral_ Notley's poems manage to mirror and transcend the times they evoke. Her profound tributes to the stages of her life and to the identities she has assumed - child_ youth_ lover_ poet_ wife_ mother_ friend_ and widow - are remarkable for their insight and wisdom - and for the courage of their unblinking gaze. 
(from the publisher)"
Close to me & Closer ... (The Language of Heaven) and Désamère,Poetry_Verse,Alice Notley's two books_ Close to me & Closer ... (The Language of Heaven) and Desamere_ are works that are wholly their art_ meaning they occur as their language shape/measure. She's invented a measure. The text is a rich current crossing_ as at the moment of imagining_ into being in death and in an expanded life. Notley transgresses conventional contemporary categories of genre; rather than genre_ the form of the writing is the mind's inner sense and motion.
The Highwayman,Poetry,A well-known poem about a highwayman and his true love_ the innkeeper's daughter
Habibi,Fiction_Children & Young Adult_Multicultural,When fourteen-year-old Liyanne Abboud_ her younger brother_ and her parents move from St. Louis to a new home between Jerusalem and the Palestinian village where her father was born_ they face many changes and must deal with the tensions between Jews and Palestinians.

Triad,Fiction_Science Fiction_Political_Dystopia/Utopia_Alien Beings_Interspecies Relations_Adventure_Space Travel & Exploration,"For two decades_ A.E. van Vogt has been one of America's most popular science fiction writers.  To thousands of readers throughout the country his name has become synonymous with imagination_ excitement and high suspense.
Now three of A.E. van Vogt's most famous novels -- three great classics of modern science fiction -- have been brought together complete in one huge omnibus volume.  This A.E. van Vogt triolgy is a genuine collector's item -- a must for every reader who has ever wanted to glimpse the wonders that lie ahead for man in space and the fugure.
The World of ä -- THe year is 2650 A.D.  Earth is a utopia whose leaders are selected by an omniscient Machine ... and whose people_ governed by a rigid scientific philosophy_ seem forever protected from strife and war.
Yet Gilbert Gosseyn faced a fact that defied all the logic of his training.  Standing before what was his own bullet-riddled corpse_ he found himself alive in an identical body! -- possessing a half-realized knowledge that offered the only hope of saving the entire solar system from conquest by alien forces.
The Voyage of the Space Beagle -- Carrying its tiny segment of humanity_ the expeditionary ship Space Beagle sped at an ever increasing velocity through a night that had no end.  Man had reached the outer planets and continued to press on_ searching out the secrets of the limitless universe.
Suddenly_ countless light-years from home_ the Space Beagle and its crew found themselves no longer detached observers_ but engaged in desperate struggles for survival with alien life forms that surpassed any earthly nightmare -- the tentacled_ catlike monster that fed on the energy of living beings ... a weird_ bird-like race with deep hypnotic powers ... a malignant creature that could pass through solid matter and sought to make the ship its home ...
Slan -- Jimmy cross was a slan.  Human beings had killed his mother.  Mankind hated and feared his entire race.  Regarded as artificially created monsters_ the slans had suffered near extinction in a series of bloody wars that left civilization in the grip of a world police state.
Though human to outer appearances_ Jimmy Cross knew that the slim_ half-concealed tentacles in his hair were both a source of his superiority and a mark by which men could recognize and hunt him down as a slan.
Now_ suddenly left alone and friendless in the world's greatest city_ Jimmy knew that his one desperate hope was to search out his fellow beings and solve the terrible mystery of his existence."

In the 23rd century_ the interplanetary Human Federation is controlled by such giant hereditary Combines as Centauri Transport_ to whom the poor of any world are little more than slave labor.  Psions -- men and women who possess any sort of psychic abilities -- are hated and feared ... particularly if they can learn Combine secrets.  But a teenage pickpocket living on the periphery of society can get by.  Even if -- like Cat_ whose green feline eyes mark him as the half-breed child of a human and a telepathic alien -- he's an outcast among outcasts.
Yet survival is never certain_ no matter how street-wise one may be.
In Psion_ Cat is picked up for stealing and sentenced to hard labot in a mining camp.  He knows it means almost certain death_ so he's more than willing to cooperate when he's drafted into an experimental group researching how psions' powers work ... and how they can be controlled.
The truth is_ Cat's own considerable talents are locked away behind an almost impenetrable mental barrier.  But before he can really awaken his telepathy_ he is betrayed...
The shock of a fellow psion's violent death has left Cat in a bad way as Catspaw begins_ bereft of his psi powers and traveling the starways in search of a new life.  He finds it -- when he's kidnapped and offered a job by Braedee_ the head of Centauri Transport's Corporate Security.
Braedee says he needs the psion's unique talents to help protect the Lady Elnear_ a crucial pawn in a Centauri Transport power struggle.  Since the Lady happens to be related to an old friend to whom Cat is indebted -- a beautiful friend who personally expresses her concern for Elnear's safety and asks the youth's help -- he's willing to go along.  Besides_ he needs the money ... and something else: the drugs Braedee gives him to amplify his telepathy.  Drugs that a psion deprived of his powers finds impossible to resist_ despite the fact that their use may destroy his talent forever."

Phase Space,Fiction_Science Fiction_Stephen  Baxter,"Tied in to Baxter's masterful Manifold trilogy_ these thematically linked stories are drawn from the vast graph of possibilities across which the lives of hero Reid Malenfant have been scattered. It is the year 2025. Reid Malenfant is the commander of a NASA earth-orbiting science platform. The platform is intended to probe the planets of the nearest star system by bouncing laser pulses off them. But no echoes are returned... and Malenfant's reality begins to crumble around him. Huddling with his family_ awaiting the end -- or an unknown new beginning -- Malenfant tells stories of other possibilities_ other realities. The linked stories encompass the myriad possibilities that might govern our relationship with the universe: are we truly alone_ or will we eventually meet other lifeforms? Perhaps intelligent species decide to turn their back on the stars_ or maybe expansionist species are destined to fail. The final possibility -- that the Universe as we know it is in fact an elaborate illusion designed to protect us from the fearful reality -- is brilliantly explored in the tour de force novella that ends the volume.

But that's just the backdrop: what makes this into retrospective sf is the introduction of a programme to build the first ballistic warplane. The story centres on Michael Kilduff_ an independent American observer who is to be part of the volplane's first launch. The story builds into a fine study of the political machinations behind the launch: the ambition and curiosity of Kilduff set against the global consequences for his country's involvement in world events if he doesn't do the right thing.

She abandons her castle to follow the lad across 12th-century Europe as he meets princes and priests_ hermits and troubadours_ and learns the secrets of chivalry_ from jousting to 'courtly love. In time their adventures take them across the sea to the decadent splendor of the Crusader kingdoms_ where they join the Leper-King of Jerusalem in his struggle to save the Holy City from Saladin and the armies of Islam.

The Service of the Sword; Worlds of Honor #4,Fiction_Science Fiction_Adventure_Militaristic,"Lady Dame Honor Harrington isn't alone. Her life touches othersand their lives touch hersdirectly_ or indirectly_ whether as a naval officer_ steadholder_ or duchess.

In this collection_ Jane Lindskold gives us the story of a prince on the brink of maturity and an extraordinary young Grayson woman named Juditha victim of Masadan brutality_ who confronts insurmountable odds in a desperate effort to lead her sisters to freedom ordeath among the stars.

Timothy Zahn weighs in with a story of the heavy cruiser HMS Fearless; a brilliant young tactical officer on temporarily detached duty; Solarian con men; secret weapons that aren't quite what they seem to be; naval spies_ spooks_ and dirty tricks; courage and honor; and a surprising glimpse into one of Admiral Sonja Hemphill's most crucial technological innovations.

John Ringo offers his unique blend of nonstop action and deliciously skewed humor in two offerings. The Peep planet of Prague and its brutally repressive StateSec regime will never be the same again after the unscheduled_ unofficial_ and thoroughly catastrophic visit by a pair of Manticoran Marines with a most peculiar taste in their holiday destinations. And then there's the question of what an explosively expanding navy does with the personnel who can't quite cut the mustard.

Eric Flint tells us the story of an idealistic young StateSec officer who finds himself in the right place at the right time following the fall of Oscar Saint-Just. Young Victor Cachat could influence the loyalty of an entire sector ... if he's only lucky enough to manage to stay alive long enough to try.

And finally_ David Weber gives us the tale of the first Grayson midshipwoman on her ""snotty cruise"" at a time when internal tensions threaten the entire future of the Manticoran Alliance and people are about to rediscover the Fact that the Peeps are far from the only predators hiding in the stars.

The Pope's Rhinoceros,Fiction_Adventure_Wild Frontiers And Exotic Lands_Historical_European_Renaissance,"A vivid_ antic_ and picaresque novel spun around one of history's most bizarre chapters: the sixteenth-century attempt to procure a rhinoceros as a bribe for Pope Leo X. Set in an age of global expansion_ The Pope's Rhinoceros holds up the history of the rhinoceros as a mirror to the obsessions and corrupt fantasies of the Renaissance. In February 1516_ a Portuguese ship sank off the coast of Italy. The Nostra Senora de Ajuda had sailed 14_000 miles from the Indian kingdom of Gujarat. Her mission: to bribe the ""pleasure-loving Pope"" into favoring expansionist Portugal over her rival Spain with the most exotic and least likely of gifts - a living rhinoceros. This strange incident is the germ of truth within the unfettered fantasy of Lawrence Norfolk's intricately plotted_ marvelously detailed_ seductively intriguing second novel - a triumph of storytelling that is as arcane and erudite as it is compelling and entertaining. Moving from the herring colonies of the Baltic Sea to the West African rainforest_ with a cast of characters including a resourceful ex-mercenary_ Salvestro; his dimwitted comrade_ Bernardo; an order of reclusive monks; and Rome's corrupt cardinals_ courtesans_ ambassadors_ and nobles_ The Pope's Rhinoceros is at once a fabulous adventure tale and a portrait of an age rushing headlong to its crisis."

Shadows of the White Sun,Fiction_Science Fiction_Love and Romance,"Most of the men and women who lived in the Hypaethra knew little about real worlds and cared even less. Descended from ancient star travelers_ they had evolved an elaborate society based on a rigid hierarchy and complex rituals_ and ruled by the will of Volshev_ Despot of Gheo. Gheo -- greatest of the huge orbiting habitats that were_ in truth_ merely the last remnants of a once-flourishing interplanetary civilization.
RIsha Skhorb was different. Raised on the planet Ethri in a diplomatic family of secondary rank_ she had made the right connections and come to Gheo_ determined to rise to a position of wealth and influence. In this she had already enjoyed some success_ having become close friends with Lachis Gloy_ for the brilliant and exquisite Lachis was married to Rhamant of Gloy -- the third most important man in the Hypaethra after Volshev and the child Emperor -- and she was quite willing to help the beautiful_ intelligent Risha find a husband of suitably high rank.
But then Risha saw Seren of Khryasha_ and heedless of conventional considerations for once_ she found herself irresistibly drawn by the sheer sensuality and power emanating from the man.
Seren was Rhamant's chief rival_ and he had a reputation for ruthlessness and cruelty as well as courage. Of lesser status than Gloy_ he had nothing to offer Risha in the way of position on Gheo_ and yet she could not quite quell her inexplicable desire for him. Not even_ to her shame_ after he murdered Rhamant.
Such a despicable crime could not go unpunished. It was believed that Seren had fled to Veii_ the second planet -- a partially terraformed world controlled by the android Firin ... who didn't want the backward Veiian people harmed by contact with the high-tech justice of the Hypaethra. Only one person would be permitted on-world to track Seren down and kill him. And_ compelled by conflicting emotions -- anger_ guilt_ honor and desire -- Risha volunteered to be Volshev's instrument.
The plan was simple. As Firin prepared her for the mission on the voyage to Veii_ teaching her the languages and cultures of that planet_ giving her drugs to darken her skin to the native hue_ and schooling her in the skill of inducing dreams through dances_ so that the people would accept the visions she sent them subliminally as communications from their gods_ and her place among them would be established.
But of course it was one thing to plot the execution of a criminal while traveling in space_ quite another to find him and carry out the sentence on a completely alien world. For with its months-long days and nights_ and its strangely beautiful culture -- a heady mixture of passion_ superstition_ gentleness and violence -- Risha found Veii to be both terrifying and exhilarating. And she was alone there_ unable to fully trust her Firin mentor_ burdened with a duty she both longed to fulfill and dreaded."

Star Rigger's Way,Fiction_Science Fiction_Alien Beings_Interspecies Relations_Adventure_Space Travel & Exploration,"Starship rigging is one of the most demanding of all professions_ requiring special aptitudes and a unique emotional nature. Because star riggers navigate not normal-space but the Flux -- a subjective sea underlying Prime Reality ... a real akin to yet distinct from pure fantasy. For even the most nightmarish fantasies are harmless_ and even the mildest eddies of the Flux can be deadly...
Gev Carlyle was a star rigger in trouble. Normally_ he had no problem constructing the appropriate images in the riggers' net_ reaching into them and grabbing literal fingerholds in the currents of the Flux. Right now_ however_ he was alone on the four-man freighter Sedora -- alone_ except for a rather large_ surly_ catlike alien named Cephean. And since Cephean was_ for reasons of his own_ unwilling to join forces with the human_ it looked like they were both going to spend eternity floating helplessly on the unwieldy_ cargo-laden vessel.
It did Carlyle little good to think back to happier times -- his days aboard the Lady Brillig. He loved her riggers_ Janofer_ Skan and Legroeder_ but had never been much good at merging his own Flux imagery with theirs. In the end_ reluctantly_ Gev had signed on the Sedora as an extra hand_ intending to rejoin the Lady crew after gaining sufficient outside experience. His plan had been working out very well_ too -- until a freak accident took the lives of his Sedora shipmates.
Stranded on the crippled freighter_ Gev's situation had appeared to be all but hopeless; and then he'd come upon a disabled alien ship drifting in the void. He had rescued its pilot -- Cephean_ a star rigger in his own right -- and was confident that they'd be able to bring the Sedora safely into port together. Unfortunately_ Cephean cared little for togetherness. Although human and nonhuman could communicate telepathically_ the oversized tabby seemed incapable of cooperating. When Cephean's carelessness nearly wrecked the freighter_ Gev tried to sail her by himself. The effort nearly proved fatal.
Gev was desperate. He had to establish a rapport with his strange companion_ yet he was reluctant to try the one method all riggers used to resolve incompatibilities: the dreampool. If he and Cephean entered the water simultaneously_ they would share each other's innermost memories_ thoughts_ visions. But would they emerge as a working unit -- or become lost in the terrors of their mutually alien minds?"

Wyke-Smith,As the title suggests_ this is a collection of early fantasy stories selected primarily for their interest to Tolkien readers.

To round out the collection_ several examples of American children's fantasy_ such as L. F. Baum_ have also been included.  The majority of the stories here represented are rather difficult to find today.  One of them_ a short one-act play by David Lindsay_ appears here in print for the first time.   Each story is prefaced by a short introduction by the editor.

Dark as Day,"Fiction_Science Fiction_Bleak Futures_Nuclear Holocaust/Post-Apocalypse_Technology_Computers, Automation, Artificial Intelligence","Dark as Day is set in the universe Sheffield created for his brilliant novel Cold as Ice. It is a universe where humanity is still limited to our solar system_ and was nearly wiped out entirely in an interplanetary war that ended some thirty years before Dark as Day begins. But not quite destroyed.  In this sequel_ Charles Sheffield returns to the human-settled solar system in the years after the Great War. That interplanetary war is over now_ but there are still horrifyingly dangerous weapons caches to threaten human survival. The solar system is finally recovering_ though. The Earth is returning to habitability_ at least in the Southern Hemisphere. The Northern Hemisphere_ target of dreadful biological weapons_ remains uninhabitable. Mars has a small population_ and the asteroids and the moons of Jupiter and Saturn are thriving centers of trade and research.  On one of those moons_ Alex Ligon_ scion of a great interstellar trading family_ has turned his back on his family business in favor of the mathematics of statistical modeling. He has developed a wonderfully accurate new population model and cannot wait until the newly reconstituted ""Seine_"" the interlinked network of computers that spans the planets and moons and asteroids_ comes back on-line. But when it does_ and he extends his perfect model a century into the future_ it predicts the complete destruction of the human race.  On another moon_ the search for extraterrestrial intelligence goes on_ undaunted by generations of failure. And to her amazement_ Millie Wu_ a young genius newly recruited to the project_ has found a signal.. a signal that is coming from outside the solar system. Deciphering this transmission will be the greatest challenge ever presented to the Puzzle Network."
Cold as Ice,Fiction_Science Fiction_Bleak Futures_Nuclear Holocaust/Post-Apocalypse,"Twenty-five years ago there was a great interplanetary war in the Solar System. It was a suicidal spasm in which terrible weapons were entered and used; in which nine billion people were killed. The rivalries that led to the war are not gone. And a few of those deadly weapons remain - some still orbiting the sun in the debris of destroyed ships_ some deliberately placed in storage.
Now Cyrus Mobarak_ the man who perfected the fusion engine_ is determined to bring human settlement to the protected seas of Europa. Opposing him is Hilda Brandt_ Europa's administrator. And caught between them are three remarkable young people: Jon Perry_ Camille Hamilton_ and Wilsa Sheer."

The Naked and the Dead,Fiction_Adventure_Military and Naval Adventure_Historical_World War II_General_General Fiction,Published in 1948_ the book was hailed as one of the finest American novels to come out of World War II. The story concerns a platoon of 13 American soldiers who are stationed on the Japanese-held island of Anopopei in the Pacific. With almost journalistic detail_ Mailer records the lives of men at war_ characterizing the soldiers individually in flashbacks that illuminate their past.
Barbary Shore,Fiction_General Fiction,Mike Lovett rents a room in a Brooklyn boarding house with the intention of writing a novel. Wounded during World War II_ Lovett is an amnesiac_ and much of his past is a secret to himself. But Lovett's housemates have secrets of their own. As these mysterious figures vie for Lovett's allegiance_ Barbary Shore plays havoc with our certainties_ combining Kafkaesque unease with Orwellian paranoia and delivering its effects with a power that Mailer has made all his own.
The Deer Park,Fiction_General Fiction,"Desert D'Or is the fashionable California resort where Hollywood's glittering elite converge when they need a break from city of celluloid dreams. It is an incestuous hothouse of a town - a haven for manipulators_ film stars_ lovers_ pimps_ producers_ whores_ gamblers_ scriptwriters and cheats.
Into this nightmare world of depravity arrives Sergius O'Shaughnessy_ recently discharged from the Air Force_ traumatized by his war experiences and trying to write the Great American Novel. But O'Shaughnessy's burning ambition begins to lose its edge; lured by greed and ruled by weakness_ he soon becomes disturbingly familiar with the dangerous life of slick compromises and a sexual follies"
Modest Gifts: Poems and Drawings,Poetry,"An unexpected collection from Norman Mailera book of his selected poems and more than one hundred of his drawings_ most of them never before published. Modest Gifts is full of what the author calls ""casual pleasures""witty_ naughty_ and surprisingly tender verse and art. Lust_ seduction_ betrayal_ jealousy_ and even the banality of cocktail party chatter are depicted with humor_ affection_ and_ above all_ honesty. Here is an aspect of Norman Mailer unknown to many: lighthearted_ prankish_ whimsical_ and often gentle_ playfully sketching the intimate urban world that surrounds us. Modest_ funny_ and true_ each poem and drawing shows a new side of one of the greatest writers of our time."

The Gospel According to the Son,Fiction_Religious_Christianity,Now Norman Mailer has written a novel about Jesus' life. Is God speaking to me? Jesus asks. Or am I hearing voices? If the voices are from God_ why has He chosen me as His son? And if they are not from God_ then who gave me the power to perform these miracles? It soon becomes evident that we are being told the story of a skilled and most devout carpenter who is living with prodigious questions. The result_ paradoxically_ is an intimately readable account of a man thrust forward by the visions he receives_ the sermons he offers_ and the miracles he enacts until he comes to the apocalyptic end of his powers. The Gospel According to the Son_ while adhering closely to the New Testament_ also succeeds in vividly re-creating the world of Galilee and Jerusalem two thousand years ago. In a time of uneasy stability_ the Holy Land is governed by a complacent but fearful establishment who rule over a despairing underclass - it is a time of great change_ open to comparison with our own. Mailer's signal accomplishment is to create for us a man wholly unlike others who is nonetheless filled with passion and doubt_ strength and weakness; a protagonist divine and human_ a son of God who shares our condition.
Why Are We in Vietnam?,Fiction_General Fiction,A novel about a hunting trip in Alaska which turns into an initiation rite. Vietnam is mentioned only once and the book can be seen either as an allegory or a symbolic psychic explanation of America's fighting in Vietnam.
An Unsocial Socialist,Fiction_General Fiction_Humor_Satire,From 1879 to 1883_ before he turned to writing plays_ Shaw wrote five novels.  An Unsocial Socialist_ the last written_ concerns the activities of one Sidney Trefusis_ a rich Marxist whom women find completely exasperating_ or irresistable_ or both_ and who has definite ideas about reforming personal and political relationships.  Shaw develops a plot that overturns the pieties of the middle class--including the expectations of the novel-reader--and in so doing suggests some new structures for both society and literature.
