Returning veterans face a crisis of identity and masculinity - and in the wide boulevards and dark canyons of the city_ a serial killer preys on young working girls who wait alone in bars or at lonely bus stops.

The suggestively named Dix Steele is an ex-airman_ an isolated_ tough-talking drifter who maintains the appearance of a nearly normal life_ but spends his nights restlessly roaming the streets of L.A. The first threat of Dix's carefully maintained charade comes in the form of a chance meeting with his best friend from the service_ now a detective assigned to the serial strangler case. Playing with fire_ Dix offers to help his buddy map the identity of the killer - and is soon providing eerily accurate theories.
Enter the femme fatale: Glamorous actress Laurel Grey has left many men in her wake and survived more than one hard knock on her way up the Hollywood ladder. In his desperate efforts to win this potent goddess_ Dix lights the fuse that will explode his rigid masculine facade. It's not his detective buddy_ but Laurel and the detective's savvy wife who see through to the truth.
As she takes us deeper into the killer's story - and into Dix's tortured soul - Hughes exposes the anatomy of postwar American misogyny. Writing in a genre dominated by such macho figures as Jim Thompson_ Raymond Chandler_ and James M. Cain_ she gives the traditional hardboiled thriller a wryly subversive gender twist.(from the publisher)",,,

But no attempt has ever been made to mine and export the ore_ because the Lodonites and the Kamarians are in a perpetual state of war. They can't even agree on the name of their planet.

Federation Headquarters sends in a diplomatic team to see what can be done. They touch down first in Lodon...and are shocked to find that the entire nation is mad. The army is a shambles_ the leaders are as insane as those they try to lead_ and the place is dangerous. The Lodonites have little or no awareness of what they're doing.
