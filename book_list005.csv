Night Pleasures,Fiction_Romance,"Dear Reader_

Have you ever wanted to know what it's like to be immortal? To journey through the night stalking the evil that preys on humans? To have unlimited wealth_ unlimited power? That is my existence_ and it is dark and dangerous. I play hero to thousands_ but am known to none. And I love every minute of it.

Or so I thought until one night when I woke up handcuffed to my worst nightmare: a conservative woman in a button-down shirt. Or in Amanda's case_ buttoned all the way up to her chin. She's smart_ sexy_ witty_ and wants nothing to do with the paranormal—in other words_ me.

My attraction to Amanda Devereaux goes against everything I stand for. Not to mention the last time I fell in love it cost me not only my human life_ but also my very soul. Yet every time I look at her_ I find myself wanting to try again. Wanting to believe that love and loyalty do exist.

Even more disturbing_ I find myself wondering if there's any way a woman like Amanda can love a man whose battle scars run deep_ and whose heart was damaged by a betrayal so savage that he's not sure it will ever beat again.

Death By Accident,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives,Texas Sheriff Dan Rhodes' cases usually concern the bad boys of rural Blacklin County_ or the slightly wacky citizens who are causing trouble that tends to be funny rather than criminal. But although at first the dead man floating in the old swimming pool at the edge of town seems to have been an accident victim - a staggering drunk tumbling into the water - Rhodes and his small but colorful staff soon uncover murder. It's the second strange death in two weeks (the other was that of John West_ killed when he blew up carrying a gasoline can across a field). But where was the Cherokee wagon John was carrying the gas to? And why is his widow so jaunty? West was a solid citizen; Pep Yeldell_ the swimming pool decedent_ was a man with many enemies. In his quiet way_ Rhodes goes about looking for a connection and a killer - a quest that takes Rhodes_ no athlete now in spite of his wife's efforts to keep him on a diet of little meat and lots of greens_ up a tree and puts him at the mercy of a vicious killer.
Crash,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Suspense_Adult/Mature Content_General Fiction_Mental Illness,Now a controversial film directed by David Cronenberg and starring James Spader_ this underground classic explores violence and eroticism in the automotive age. The new-style TV scientist Dr. Robert Vaughan has a fetish for car wrecks -- the ghastly union of steel_ glass_ and flesh. His fantasies of mayhem on the freeways culminate in a monstrous obsession: to orchestrate a head-on collision between his own car and Elizabeth Taylor's limousine.
A Ghost of a Chance,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives,"Dan Rhodes_ the easygoing sheriff of Blacklin County_ Texas_ has won the hearts of readers since the rural lawman's first Anthony-winning adventure_ Too Late To Die. Although the elderly members of his staff_ Hack the dispatcher and Lawton_ the jailer_ keep trying to drag Rhodes into the Twenty-first century_ Rhodes prefers to rely on his plentiful supply of common sense rather than highfalutin' technical instruments to solve his cases - and solve them he does.

The two old fellows and their ongoing (and good-natured) feuds have always provided fine comedy relief to the bizarre crimes that plague Rhodes's bailiwick_ but the challenge in this episode tops them. The incarcerated prisoners are raising the complaint that the jail itself is haunted and they are backed up in this supernatural frenzy by a group of teenagers who burst into the jail screaming that they've seen ghosts in the local cemetery.

It's true that there has been vandalism and robbery at the cemetery_ and gravestones and memorial statues are being stolen. But are these ghosts really ghosts? And is there a connection between the two sets of manifestations? All of this becomes a trivial concern when the body of Ty Berry_ the leader of the crusade to save the cemetery_ is discovered in an open grave. There's almost no evidence; Rhodes is thrown back on his own cunning to solve the murder and exorcise the ghosts"
A Romantic Way to Die,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives,"Dan Rhodes_ the sheriff of Blacklin County_ Texas_ has seen more than his share of strange events during his time in office-most recently he exorcised a ghost from the county jail and he has always tolerated the banter between his elderly jailer and dispatcher. However_ not even Hack and Lawton's friendly word play could have prepared him for the group of writers that have descended upon Blacklin County.

When Vernell Lindsey_ Clearview's newly published romance novelist_ decides to hold a romance writer's convention_ residents think this will finally get their town on the map. They are even more excited when they learn that former Clearview resident Terry Don Coslin will headline the event-Terry Don is now the most sought after male cover model for these very novels.

Rhodes doesn't understand why so many people are interested in writing_ but this becomes the least of his concerns when a local aspiring novelist is found dead in her room at the college. Was her death the work of a jealous rival? Or did her new book get a bit too close to certain people's real lives? As he investigates_ Rhodes begins to learn more about the publishing industry and some sordid facts Terry Don. Is he at all connected to the murder?

When another murder occurs_ Rhodes receives the unwelcome aid of two aspiring novelists_ eager to switch from romance to mysteries. Their theories are a little too far from the truth_ but Rhodes does make some headway on his own. Relying on his trademark common sense and cunning and the help of his deputy sheriff Ruth Grady_ Rhodes is able to solve the murders although he still can't figure out why so many people want to write a novel."

...A Dangerous Thing,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives_Amateur,Professor Carl Burns knew the new dean wasn't going to work out when she bought the two goats. And that was the least of the problems. Hartley Gorman College was being attacked - with a vengeance - by the forces of political correctness_ and the new dean was an unreconstructed hippie. Courses would have to be rewritten_ manners watched... and everyone knew Burns should have been the new dean_ anyway. As if this weren't enough to contend with_ Tom Henderson's fatal fall through a window definitely wasn't part of the planned curriculum.

Strate's growing friendship with Sally Radford_ the daughter of one of the Cotton Jammers_ brings him closer to cornering the thieves - if they don't get Strate first. But when the cat-and-mouse game becomes deadly_ the two gunmen begin to realize the shattering implications of the sinister political plot that has emeshed them all.

They want their truth to be the truth.

These stories have been selected and edited by Stewart Wieck_ creator of Mage: the Ascension and co-creator of the World of Darkness.

The Night Watcher,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Suspense,Set in post 9/11 Manhattan_ Lutz's (The Night Caller) gritty psychological thriller finds NYPD homicide detectives Rica Lopez and Ben Stack on the hunt for a vengeful serial killer whose modus operandi includes binding and burning his prey in their high-rise co-ops. The only clue they have to go on is that the Torcher has an apparent penchant for wealthy victims_ so they start at square one and investigate all of the known arsonists in the city. In the end_ Rica and Stack prove to be no match for the Torcher_ who manages to stay several steps ahead of them until the very end_ but their lack of leads doesn't make this book any less compelling. Lutz's details concerning police procedure_ fire-fighting techniques and FDNY policy ring true_ and his clever use of flashbacks draws the reader deep into the killer's troubled psyche. The novel's primary weaknesses include the tenuous romantic link between Ben and Rica_ frequent point-of-view shifts and an overwhelming parade of possible suspects ranging from an avaricious real-estate magnate and her aging male escort to a lesbian mayoral campaign manager. (And I have no idea whose review this is...found it on eBay.)
The Night Caller,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Crime/Caper,When he stumbles across his only daughter's corpse in a deserted beachfront bungalow_ devastated Ezeklel Cooper vows to find her murderer. What the former NYPD detective doesn't know is that there have been other victims_ women in Queens_ Sarasota_ and Seattle_ who seemingly had nothing in common_ aside from a grisly fate at the hands of a chillingly clever stranger.

The bone is human_ probably part of a large male's leg_ which suggests two immediate problems: a murder may have occurred at the Spenser and Angelotti store and a potential health hazard may exist in the store's butcher shop and meat cases. Cat's purchase was packaged in plastic_ tucked in next to the beef_ lamb_ and pork. How much meat has been contaminated? How many other customers will face similar surprises?

Someone far more evil than the Wicked Witch is in pursuit_ and the magical world of Oz seems very far away."

Sara Paretsky_ John D. MacDonald_ Nancy Pickard and Barbara Michaels are among those represented in Women on the Edge_ a collection of fourteen classic tales by modern masters of the short-form mystery. Their common theme: women who have been pushed to the limit of physical_ mental or emotional endurance. Some of the women in these stories_ like Sara Paretsky's Chicago private detective V. I. Warshawsky_ who investigates a murder in ""The Case of the Pietro Andromache_"" live in sophisticated big cities. Others_ like the woman in Nancy Pickard's ""Afraid All the Time_"" seek the deceptive peace of country life. Sometimes it is the woman who is the menace_ as in ""A Crime of Passion"" by Richard T. Chizmar_ in which a writer's violent and erotic work has made him the target of a fanatical anti-pornography group led by a beautiful but obsessed woman. Others are young and vulnerable_ like the teenage runaways who encounter a mysterious young man in an abandoned farmhouse in Barbara Michael's ""The Runaway."" Blood plays a major part in ""Seeing Red"" by Barbara Collins in which a hot-tempered young attorney in the throes of P.M.S. clashes with an insurance salesman in a mid-life crisis. Then there are John D. MacDonald's feisty war widow in ""Betrayed""; a suburban mother who tangles with a hit man in Howard Browne's ""House Call""; a runaway wife sought by Loren D. Estleman's hard boiled private eye Amos Walker in ""I'm in the Book""; and a world-weary beauty who exorcises twenty-five-year-old demons at her high school reunion in Ed Gorman's ""The Reason Why."" There are still more women on the edge in stories by Bill Pronzini_ Wayne D. Dundee_ Bill Crider_ Max Allan Collins and Marcia Muller.

The Adventures of Samurai Cat,Fiction_Fantasy_Humorous,"This book is the first and best in the series_ and contains the following sections:


KATEMUSHA
---------
In feudal Japan_ loyal samurai Miaowara Tomokato returns from a family visit to find his lord dead in a scene of destruction that's completely spoiled me for similar scenes forever. Maybe it's the arrow-ridden dragon in Red Army uniform_ or the landgoing replica of the Merrimac.

""From his vantage-point Takeda Katsuyori surveyed the grim scene. 'Fudge_"" he gritted.""

THE BRIDGE OF KATZAD-DUM
------------------------
Samurai Cat pursues one of his lord's killers into Tolkien country_ dealing with such critters as porks and the dread B'aalhop.

""The katana whirred and flamed_ slicing through tentacle after tentacle_ whistling in a constantly repeated *Datsun Tempura*_ or Divine Whirling Outboard Motor Propeller Blow.""

THE BOOK OF THE DUNWICH COW
---------------------------
The setting: a Lovecraftian town whose houses consist only of gabled attics to hide the squamous half-human denizens of Outsmouth.

""Yog N'goggawoggah and Yoknapatawpha_ twin masses of stone-cold cream chip beef that ooze sluggishly in the center of all time and space_ are their chiefs_ terrible in combat_ unappetizing to behold. Their herald and messenger is Stor-Atroomtemp_ Lord of the Luke-warm_ Cosmic Blight_ Master-of-Many-Shapes-and-Interesting-in-None-of-Them. Their publicity is handled by the horrendous Isaac Azathoth....""

BEYOND THE BLACK WALNUT
-----------------------
Another murderer_ Thpageti-Thoth_ has fled into savage Pictland. Illustrated in gorgeous Frazetta parodies_ the story shows Samurai Cat's meeting with Con-Ed the Barbarian.

""Amalric the East Anglian..._ armored in a scale-mail corselet_ was a tall weasly-looking teenager whose spiky hairdo sent orange and purple tufts up through the holes he had deliberately punched in his own helmet. His only weapon was a gigantic Wilkinson sword razor-blade with the words 'Hi Mum' written on it in crimson lipstick.""

AGAINST THE GODS
----------------
Tomokato's search takes him next to Asgard_ as the gods prepare for the final war against the giants of the Greater Jotunheim Co-Prosperity Sphere.

""Odin nodded his grimly regal head and picked up the microphone for his P.A. system. 'Attention_ attention_' he began. 'This is Odin_ Lord of the Hanged. Ketil Jormunreksson_ report to the Throne-Room_ on the double.'"""
More Adventures of Samurai Cat,Fiction_Fantasy_Humorous,"Samurai cat Miaowara Tomokato_ introduced in The Adventures of Samurai Cat_ returns here in three illustrated_ novella-length parodies. In ""A Samurai Cat in King Arthur's Court_"" Tomokato joins the Round Table. As ""A Fighting Cat of Mars_"" he troops through the world of Edgar Rice Burroughs. And ""The Empire State Strikes Back"" takes him on a visit to a galaxy ""far (but not far far) away."" The satire is based on frequent interjection of contemporary references. (For example_ when asked_ ""What is the purpose of your visit to Lord Mordred's realm?"" Tomokato_ posing as a book reviewer_ replies_ ""I've been sent to attend an ABA convention in York."") Rogers falters when he uses the anachronistic and often humorless device of mentioning various fantasy films and filmmakers. However_ he succeeds as a humorous illustrator_ eschewing simple_ cartoon-like effects in favor of fully rendered artwork that is appropriately evocative of pulp magazine illustration."
Samurai Cat in the Real World,Fiction_Fantasy_Humorous,""

Jonathan believes he is in Cortton to save the villagers_ to lay the dead to rest.But if Harkon Lukas escapes his curse and can travel the Dark Domains as he pleases... the slaughter has only begun."
A Kiss of Shadows,Fiction_Fantasy_Dark Fantasy_Adult/Mature Content,"All it would take was my true name being mentioned after dark_ and it would float back to my aunt. She was the Queen of Air and Darkness_ and that meant that anything said in the dark was hers to hear_ eventually. The fact that spotting the missing Elven American Princess had become more popular than spotting Elvis helped. Her magic was always chasing blind leads. Princess Meredith skiing in Utah.

So now the men of my royal guard—frightening warriors skilled with blade_ spell_ and gun—have become my lovers_ auditioning with pleasure for the role of future king and father of my child. And they must still protect me from assassination attempts—for unlike most of the fey_ I am part human_ and very mortal. All this royal back–stabbing makes it very difficult for me to pursue my living as a private investigator in Los Angeles_ especially since the media made sure the whole world knows the Faerie princess is alive and well in sunny California.

Now_ in the City of Angels_ people are dying in mysterious_ frightening ways. What the human police dont realize is that the killer is hunting the fey as well. Havoc lies on the horizon: the very existence of the place known as Faerie is at grave risk.

"Jessica Fletcher Presents...More Murder, They Wrote",Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives_J. A. Jance,"Dear Mystery Fans_
I am so thrilled to present the third volume in this wonderful series_ a collection of compelling_ all-new mysteries.  From classic crimes in the English drawing room to the bustling chaos of New York City to an intriguing murder in medieval Japan_ here are fourteen fascinating whodunits in the beloved tradition of the television show Murder_ She Wrote.

Some of the top mystery writers today have contributed their talents to this exciting collection.  A battle of wills over an inheritence turns sour for two siblings in J.A. Jance's ""The Prodigal.""  Being left at the altar isn't necessarily the disaster it first seems when Sharan Newman's heroine solves a murder in ""Honeymoon for One.""  And when a strange dream awakens a young woman from her bed_ she realizes the truth behind a greater nightmare of murder in ""The Man in Her Dream"" by Margaret Coel.  Enjoy this treasure trove of mysteries_ with enough chills and puzzling clues to delight the biggest mystery fan!

The Riddle-Master of Hed,Fiction_Fantasy_Children & Young Adult_Fantasy Worlds_Patricia A.  McKillip,"Long ago_ the wizards had vanished from the world_ and all knowledge was left hidden in riddles. Morgon_ prince of the simple farmers of Hed_ proved himself a master of such riddles when he staked his life to win a crown from the dead Lord of Aum.

But now ancient_ evil forces were threatening him. Shape changers began replacing friends until no man could be trusted. So Morgon was forced to flee hostile kingdoms_ seeking the High One who ruled from mysterious Erlenstar Mountain.

Beside him went Deth_ the High One's Harper. Ahead lay strange encounters and terrifying adventures. And with him always was the greatest of unsolved riddles -- the nature of the three stars on his forehead that seemed to drive him toward his ultimate destiny."
Heir of Sea and Fire,Fiction_Fantasy_Children & Young Adult_Fantasy Worlds_Patricia A.  McKillip,"By the vow of her father and her own desire_ Raederle was pledged to Morgon_ Riddle-Master of Hed. But a year had passed since Morgon disappeared on his search for the high one at Erlenstar Mountain_ and rumors claimed he was dead.

Raederle set out to learn the truth for herself_ though her small gift of magic seemed too slight for the perils she must face. The quest led through strange lands and dangerous adventures. Only her growing powers enabled her at last to reach Erlenstar Mountain. And there she discovered what she could not bear to accept.

Accompanied by Deth_ the High One's Harper_ she fled. And behind them came a pursuer whose name was Morgon_ bent on executing a grim destiny upon Raederle and Deth.

Her only hope lay in summoning the Hosts of the Dead_ led by the King whose skull she bore..."

Opening Shots: Great Mystery and Crime Writers Share Their First Published Stories,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Crime/Caper_Dorothy Salisbury  Davis_Peter  Lovesey_Sara  Paretsky,"Edited by: Lawrence Block

Readers enthralled by the works of great mystery and crime writers will find something new in Opening Shots. This collection offers not only the first published short stories of twenty prominent writers_ but also features each author's recollection of the trials and thrills of making that unforgettable first sale.

Opening Shots humanizes legendary writers and revisits the cutting-edge work from which raw talents broke through in bold and soemtimes experimental fashion. Joan Hess's ""Death of a Romance Writer"" offers a nifty and humorous literary twist-an inside joke- that Hess describes as ""a dollop of revenge for all the abused heroines of romantic fiction."" But there's nothing funny about James Sallis's ""Jim and Mary G_"" a disturbing story with a sad conclusion that can be interpreted in more than one way. Says Sallis_ ""I was just starting to try and write stories that might be read in several ways_ or on several levels_ simultaneously.""

Between its wide variety of stories and styles and its candid personal refelctions from the authors thenselves. Opening Shots is a compelling anthology that entertains and offers a glimpse beyond the page and into the mind of the writer.

Murderous Schemes: An Anthology of Classic Detective Stories,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives_Thomas  Burke_Peter  Lovesey_Lawrence  Block,"Edited by: Donald E. Westlake and J. Madison Davis
When plotting a murder (figuratively speaking)_ the mystery writer has at hand any number of M.O.s_ including such tried and true conventions as the locked room_ the unbreakable alibi_ the double bluff_ and the mistaken identity. Now_ in Murderous Schemes_ renowned mystery writers Donald E. Westlake and J. Madison Davis offer an illuminating look at eight such mystery conventions_ illustrating each with four short stories written by some of the masters of the form. The resulting collection of thirty-two tales spans a hundred and fifty years of crime fiction and includes virtually every style imaginable_ from the hard-boiled detective story to the cozy armchair mystery.

Here Westlake and Davis provide the avid mystery reader (and the budding mystery writer) with a glimpse behind the curtain_ allowing them to compare for themselves how some of the great crime writers worked their magic on a particular convention. These tales highlight not only differences between individual writers_ but also the differences between American and British detective fiction_ and they illuminate the evolution of crime writing over time. Here is a glorious treasure chest of tales that cover every crime in the book_ written by a who's who of crime fiction--Edgar Allan Poe_ Wilkie Collins_ Arthur Conan Doyle_ G. K. Chesterton_ Raymond Chandler_ Dorothy L. Sayers_ Chester Himes_ Edward D. Hoch_ and Lawrence Block_ to name but a few.

Bringing together a century and a half of superb crime stories_ Murderous Schemes is a glorious collection that will inform and delight anyone who loves mystery and mayhem.

To some_ such prognostications may bear little consequence_ but in these tales_ as skeptics and scoffers sadly learn_ nothing zodiacal can be taken too lightly. Indeed_ the simple question ""What's your sign?"" may prove to be a matter of life or death. From the Age of Aquarius to the House of the Rising Sun_ from Capricorn to Sagittarius_ the tales in this anthology explore murderous portents and deadly reckonings that lie in the astral plane and wreak havoc in the human heart.

Building on the success of NAKED CAME THE STRANGER--a collaborative effort of 20 Newsday staffers back in 1969--and on the success of NAKED CAME THE MANATEE--a suspense thriller cooked up by 13 Miami-based writers in 1995--now comes NAKED CAME THE FARMER_ a satirical_ round-robin murder mystery drawing on the talents of some of Illinois' top writers."

The Forest: A Novel,Fiction_Historical_Epics_European_British Isles_England,"The New Forest lies in a vast bowl scooped from England's southern coast. To its west runs the river Avon_ from Sarum to the harbor at Christchurch_ and to its east the port of Southampton. In the heart of the New Forest itself_ some one hundred thousand acres of forest and heath sweep down to the Solent water and the Isle of Wight and overlook the English Channel just beyond.

From the time of the Norman Conquest to the present day_ the New Forest has remained a mysterious_ powerful_ almost mythical place. It is here that Saxon and Norman kings rode forth with their hunting parties_ and where William the Conqueror's son Rufus was mysteriously killed. The mighty oaks of the forest were used to build the ships for Admiral Nelson's navy_ and the fishermen who lived in Christchurch and Lymington helped Sir Francis Drake fight off the Spanish Armada. The New Forest is the perfect backdrop for the families who people this epic story -- a story that makes clear the connections between the dark_ dangerous_ sensuous life of the primeval forest and the genteel life of Georgian and Regency society.

There are well-born ladies and lowly woodsmen_ sailors and smugglers_ witches and Cistercian monks_ who live in the lovely abbey of Beaulieu. The Forest's Lady Adela is the cousin of Walter Tyrrell_ who is blamed for the death of Rufus_ son of the Conqueror. There is Brother Adam of Beaulieu_ who is content with his service to God until a poaching incident puts him in contact with an intriguing young woman named Mary Furzey. There is the merchant Totton family of the harbor town of Lymington_ and the Penruddocks and Lisles of Moyles Court.

The new hire has to be willing to accept Emma's far from handsome salary offer. That's okay with Billie August; she's glad to find someone who will train and pay her any salary at all. Billie is a single mother with no practical job skills_ which she demonstrates by botching her first assignment. 

When the case of a missing teenager comes along_ Emma reluctantly and with reservations gives Billie one more chance. Although the missing girl's mother claims her daughter Penny has been seduced into joining a cult_ the young man who drove Penny away is actually a member of a benign_ established international group that enjoys recreating the Middle Ages. What turns out to be perilous_ however_ is a locket Penny finds in the meadow where a tournament is being held.

Whatever Doesn't Kill You,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives_Private Detective,"Private investigator Emma Howe's hiring of young Billie August was an act of desperation.

But both women were surprised to find that in spite of Billie's inexperience and the difficulty of working under Emma_ they were slowly coming to respect one another.

Now they are faced with two cases of more than the routine surveillance of suspected insurance fraud perpetrators. A young man of deficient mental ability has been accused of the murder of a woman who had befriended him on their daily jogging route. Emma has handed this case to Billie; the evidence against him is convincing and she has no hope that the younger woman can come up with anything new_ but the youth's mother is willing to pay_ so let Billie handle it. Emma herself takes on another case that seems to lead to a dead end -- a young woman who knows she is adopted wants to find her birth mother; her adoptive mother refuses to cooperate. There's not much hope that either case will come up with anything helpful_ but both the youth's mother and the adopted woman are anxious to try_ and the fees will pay the month's rent at least.

If either detective could extract information from the frightened young man_ it would be gentle Billie rather than impatient Emma_ who has a tendency to bully. Billie_ whose own five-year-old son requires a knowing touch_ gradually calms the troubled youth; Emma_ meanwhile_ is making progress on her own case_ and the two detectives are not only amazed to find that the two seemingly so-different cases are moving closer and closer together_ but that they may_ indeed_ be successful in each.

What they also find_ however_ almost too late_ is that the secrets they are uncovering are leading them into peril of their own lives."

Reflections,Poetry,This book is a collection of poetry about life_ love (or lack thereof)_ joy_ and personal growth.
El amor en los tiempos del cólera,Fiction_General Fiction,"It was inevitable  So begins this story set in a country on the Caribbean coast of South Americaa story that ranges from the late nineteenth century to the early decades of our own_ tracing the lives of three people and their entwined fates. And yet_ at first nothing seems inevitable_ for this is a tale of unrequited love. Fifty years_ nine months_ and four days worth_ to be exact. For that is how long Florentino Ariza has waited to declare_ once again_ his undying love to Fermina Daza_ whom he courted and almost won so many years before. He has the bad grace_ however_ to make his declaration at the funeral of her husband_ one of the most illustrious men of his time_ a patron of the arts_ distinguished professor of medicine_ and leader in the fight against the cholera epidemics taht once ravaged the country. Shaken by Florentinos bold speech_ Fermina banishes him from her house.

But that is only the beginning. With the craft_ humor_ and accumulated wisdom of a master of fiction_ Garcia Marquez transports them (and the reader) back to those early days when they first met_ courted_ and were forced apart. He shows them going their very different waysFlorentino with his poetry_ his rise to prominence in business_ and (his devotion to Fermina Daza notwithstanding) his constant pursuit of women. And we see Fermina as she is wooed by the most sought-after bachelor of their time_ Doctor Juvenal Urbino de la Calle; as they wed; as they experience all the events and emotionshoneymoon_ passion_ children_ small betrayals_ separations_ dependencies_ and adventuresthat constitute a long_ sturdy marriage. And then_ at what might seem the end of their lives_ Fermina Daza and Florentino Ariza are brought togethr once more_ in a meeting whose outcome is as fateful_ as suspenseful_ as any in literature."
The Milagro Beanfield War,Fiction_General Fiction_Humor_Regional Interest,It was a soft_ early spring morning with the mist still clinging to the mountain and the blackbirds just starting to swoop low over the alfalfa fields when Jo Mondragon - thirty-six with not much to show for it_ a feisty hustler with a talent for trouble - slammed his battered pick-up to a stop_ tugged on his gumboots_ and marched into the arid patch of ground his father had once cultivated. Carefully_ impulsively (and also illegally)_ he tapped into the main irrigation channel. And so began - though few knew it at the time (least of all Joe) - the great Milagro beanfield war. But like everything else in the dirt-poor town of Milagro_ it would be a patchwork war_ fought more by tactical retreats than battlefield victories. Gradually_ ever so fumblingly_ the small farmers and sheepmen began to rally to Joe's beanfield as the symbol of their lost rights and their lost lands. And downstate in the capital_ the Anglo water barons and power brokers huddled in urgent conference_ intent on destroying that symbol before it destroyed their multimillion-dollar land-development schemes. The tale of Milagro's rising is widly comic and lovingly tender_ a vivid portrayal of a town that_ half-stumbling and partly prodded_ groped its way toward it own stubborn salvation.
The Guns of Navarone,Fiction_Adventure_Military and Naval Adventure,It was a suicide mission. An entire navy had tried to silence the German gun emplacement at Navarone...and failed.

Force Ten from Navarone,Fiction_Adventure_Military and Naval Adventure,The surviving members of the assault on Navarone continue the fight against the Nazis in wartime Yugoslavia.
Where Eagles Dare,Fiction_Adventure_Military and Naval Adventure,Forbidding peaks_ resourceful commandos_ beautiful spies_ nonstop action_ and neck-snapping plot twists make this the classic adventure thriller—the kind of page-turner that readers actually will find impossible to put down. A team of British Special Forces commandos parachutes into the high peaks of the Austrian Alps with the mission of stealing into an invulnerable alpine castle—accessible only by aerial gondola—the headquarters of Nazi intelligence. Supposedly sent in to rescue one of their own_ their real mission turns out to be a lot more complicated—and the tension climbs as team members start to die off_ one by one. Written by Alistair Maclean_ author of the Guns of Navarone_ this is the novel that set the pace for the modern action thriller (the film version_ with Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood_ also helped)_ and it still packs twice the punch of most contemporary best-selling thrillers. What's more_ the cast of spooks_ turncoats_ and commandos who drive this story are more relevant than ever in our new era of special forces_ black ops_ and unpredictable alliances.

Lynn_Tanith  Lee,"A volume of wonders - magical tales of trolls and ogres_ of bewitched princesses and kingdoms accursed_ penned by some of the most acclaimed fantasists of our day.

For fans of the movie and the series alike_ here is the original version of that perfectly corrupt football game_ those martini-laced mornings and sexual escapades_ and that unforgettable foray into assisted if incompleted suicideall as funny and poignant now as they were before they became a part of America's culture and heart."

The changes in eleven-year-old Regan were so gradual_ too_ that Chris_ busy filming a new picture_ did not recognize for some time how much her daughter's behavior had altered. And even when she did_ the endless medical tests that followed shed no light on Regan's symptoms_ which grew increasingly severe and frightening. It was almost as if a different personality had invaded the little girl. The very house thickened with the sense of an evil presence.

Desperate_ Chris turned from the doctors to Father Damien Karras_ a Jesuit priest who was trained as a psychiatrist and also had a deep knowledge of such phenomena as satanism and possesion. Was it possible that a demonic force was at large? If psychiatry could not help_ might exorcism be the answer?

Damien Karras resisted the idea. In its long history the Church has been profoundly skeptical of possession. But_ finally_ it came down to a matter of Regan's life or death. And that meant the time had come for that implacable rite that binds exorcist and demon in literally mortal combat.

No reader of this fantastic and deeply religious novel will come away untouched by the power of that ritual_ or unaffected by those things in this world which cannot be explained by the most rational inquiry_ the most informed skepticism. 

Was Regan possesed?"

The Dark Snow and Other Mysteries,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Brendan  DuBois,"To say that Brendan DuBois writes Thrillers is equivalent to saying that Fabergé was pretty good at decorating eggs. Not exactly wrong but a vast understatement of their accomplishments. Brendan DuBois's stories are not only filled with conflict_ tension_ and mystery_ but they also dig into the issues that dominate our times. Several of them_ like the Edgar-nominated title story_ are about people who served in the murky and amoral world of international intrigue and now want only tranquility in a New England town  but their pasts come back. Others_ like the Shamus-winning ""The Road's End_"" combine detection with the tension of the hunt  but who is the hunter and who the hunted? The stories are about revenge and betrayal_ but above all they are about putting down roots and finding identity.

The Blue and the Gray Undercover: All New Civil War Spy Adventures,Fiction_Adventure_Spy/Espionage_Historical_North America_American Civil War,"Edited by Ed Gorman.

Battles were won with bullets and sabers on the battlefields of the War Between the States_ for sure. But often_ the outcome of those battles was affected by the heroic acts of spies--both Union and Confederate. Such heroes_ unsung while they did their vital work_ included those whose true stories are told in the pages of this book:

 Elizabeth Van Lew: Her Richmond_ Virginia_ neighbors thought her eccentric--or crazy--but her odd behavior covered her activities as a spy for the Union army.

 Belle Boyd: A daring Confederate spy whose charm and beauty were exceeded only by her boldness and resourcefulness in eluding Union's efforts to capture her.

 Serena Freneau: A beautiful spy who seduced secrets from Union officers--even marrying one of them!

 Timothy Webster: A Union spy who dared to infiltrate the South's infamous ""Knights of Liberty"" as a double agent.

Their exploits_ and the other tales in this extraordinary volume_ are as thrilling as any spy stories from the past or present--and many of them are true history.

The Blue and the Gray Undercover

No war is won on the battlefield alone_ and the Civil War was no exception. Behind the lines_ behind closed doors_ in disguise_ spies for both the Union and the Confederacy did what spies have always done: seek out information that will help their side get some advantage over the enemy.

In the pages of this unique volume some of the most gifted storytellers of our generation write about many different spies. Editor Ed Gorman has brought together never-before-published tales of undercover work during the War Between the States by such bestselling authors as Doug Allyn_ John Lutz_ Brendan DuBois_ Loren D. Estleman_ and by other talented writers_ including Janet Berliner_ James H. Cobb_ Bill Crider_ Jane Haddam_ Edward D. Hoch_ Marie Jakober_ Jane Lindskold_ P. G. Nagle_ Gary Phillips_ Robert J. Randisi_ Kristine Kathryn Rusch_ Aileen Schumacher_ and Ray Vukcevich.

In cities and in the wild_ north and south of the Mason-Dixon line_ in the Atlantic Ocean_ the Caribbean Sea--even in Canada--these stories capture the tension and excitement of the high-stakes risks numberless people took to help their side in the terrible war that sundered a nation.

Not all the stories are based on fact_ but all show people doing the kinds of things that were actually done to win the war with brains instead of bullets. The result is a fascinating look at a little-known part of our Civil War heritage."

Murder Most Sacred: Great Catholic Tales of Mystery and Suspense,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Crime/Caper_Religious_Christianity,"These 11 ""great Catholic tales of mystery and suspense"" provide a treat for mystery fans_ whatever their religious leanings. G. K. Chesterton's ""The Oracle of the Dog"" occupies pride of place_ as his clear-eyed Father Brown differentiates between the truth of a dog's role in a crime and the illusion accepted by gullible folk. This story's ingenious plot and style represents the collection's overall quality_ although each tale has its own special characteristic. Poignancy is achieved in Hoch's ""The Sweating Statue_"" about a discounted miracle; anguish expressed in Brendan DuBois's ""Final Marks_ Final Secrets_"" about a man doomed to a lifetime of regret for failing to confess a childhood peccadillo; humor released in ""The Devil and His Due"" by Dorothy Salisbury Davis_ whose young hero foils a book thief. All entries are by distinguished authors_ including Simenon_ Antonia Fraser_ Anthony Boucher and Marcia Muller.

In addition to being the title of this anthology_ ""Speaking of Greed"" is also the title of Lawrence Block's original novella that leads off this unique collection.

""My task as an anthologist in this series_"" Block write in the introduction_ ""is threefold: first_ I have to pick the stories; then I have to write a longish novella with my four series characters_ whom we know only as the priest_ the doctor_ the soldier_ and the policeman; finally_ I have to hammer out an introduction.""

The stories Block has chosen are delightful. His novella delivers what he promises. And the introduction is a heads-up plea for authors to ensure that their work will continue to be read after they are no longer around to write any more.

Dead Men Don't Give Seminars,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives_Private Detective,When young P.I. Vic Newman is invited to Vermont by his boss_ Sabina Swift_ and her physics professor husband_ he expects a quiet summer weekend at the Lake Champlain Physics Institute. But when one Nobel Laureate is poisoned at an institute cocktail party_ and another Nobel Laureate is the prime suspect_ Sabina and Vic find themselves at the center of the most violent shock to the physics world since the Big Bang.
Dead Men Don't Marry,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives_Private Detective,Victor Newman gets a bit of a shock when he arrives home after a long absence and his message machine bears an invitation to the wedding of his neighbor_ a middle-aged widow who has been almost a mother to him since his childhood. He's too late-not only has the wedding taken place while he was away_ but his newlywed neighbor has been killed when a train struck her car at a grade crossing. As Vic learns more_ he becomes suspicious of the official version of her death.
A Novena for Murder,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives_Amateur,Sister Mary Helen_ at seventy-five_ had resisted retirement. She feared she'd find only prayer_ peace_ and little pinochle. But she'd no sooner arrive at Mount St. Francis College for Women in San Francisco when she was greeted by an earthquake_ a hysterical secretary_ and a fatally bludgeoned history professor.
Advent of Dying,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives_Amateur,"She had vowed to give up reading mysteries for Advent. But Sister Mary Helen hadn't the foggiest notion that she was about to be back in the business of solving them.

Always of catholic mind_ she had rushed in where angels fear to treat--to Ghirardelli Square's swinging Sea Wench Bar--to hear her usually quiet secretary belt out the blues. But Sister May Helen's surprise at Suzanne's talents soon tumed to shock...at her murder. It was a matter of conscience to investigate_ but her good intentions soon led her from the paths of righteousness into one of the deadliest secrets of the heart."
The Missing Madonna,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives_Amateur,Sister Mary Helen is sinfully good at snooping through the San Francisco fog. Now a fellow OWL (Older Woman's League) member has disappeared. The police believe Erma Duran simply flew the coop_ but Sister feels a Higher Authority pushing her to investigate. A gold medal entangled in Erma's bedsprings and a cryptic clue to a Byzantine madonna deepens the mystery. By the time Police Inspector Kate Murphy joins the hunt_ Sister's good intentions have already paved her way straight to the Mission Districtand a hellish encounter with sudden death.
Murder in Ordinary Time,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives_Amateur,"Just one bite of that irresistible Christmas cookie and Christina Kelly_ Channel 5's leading investigative reporter_ was on the airdead. The odor of bitter almond told Sister May Helen the cause of the death: cyanide. Somewhere in the studio was the wily killer_ a person everyone knew....

Had Christina's investigations led her to her dead end? Or was the fatal cookie meant for someone else: the notorious womanizer; the hard-drinking floor manager with something to hide; or perhaps Wicked Wendy_ who certainly fit her nickname? Or was the intended victim the intrepid nun herself?

Heaven help her as Sister Mary Helen charges in where angels fear to tread to trap a killer before he strikes again...."
Murder Makes a Pilgrimage,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives_Amateur,"Sister Mary Helen and her dear old friend Sister Eileen can't believe their luck when they win a free trip to Santiago_ Spain. Surely the contest_ held by the nervous owner of a Spanish restaurant where the nuns sometimes dine_ must be rigged? Or was there a bit of intervention - divine or otherwise - that secured the two sisters places in a small tour group? 

Never mind. The sisters are far too excited at the thought of beautiful faraway Spain to worry unduly and decide to count their blessings instead. There's certainly an interesting group of fellow pilgrims traveling with them_ including a melancholy professor and his wife_ a woman clearly frantic to look ever-youthful; the arguing Bowmans_ who grate on everyone's nerves; the dentist and his bouncy wife_ so into aerobic exercise; and the two misfit young women_ peculiar friends given that one of them is a beautiful temptress_ the other a lonely_ sullen lump of a girl.

Unfortunately_ Sister Mary Helen's luck seems to take a turn for the worst not long after she arrives in Spain. On an early morning visit to the famous cathedral in Santiago_ she stumbles upon the strangled body of one of the tour group. Suddenly everyone comes under suspicion as the police start their investigation into the lurid crime. Meanwhile_ Sister Mary Helen can't keep from nosing around to see if she can solve the murder. 

But strange - and frightening - things begin to happen to Sister Mary Helen not long after she discovers the body. Increasingly it seems that someone is stalking the intrepid nun. Does the murderer simply want to put an end to her amateur sleuthing before she solves the mystery? Either Sister Mary Helen must come up with the murderer's identity - and fast - or all the prayers in the world can't save her!"
Death Goes on Retreat,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives_Amateur,"When Sister Mary Helen and Sister Eileen are dropped off at St. Colette's for the nuns' annual retreat weekend_ the two nuns from Mount St. Francis College expect to have a quiet two days away from the hustle and bustle of San Francisco. Instead_ they discover that they're a week early and it is in fact a priests' retreat. Unable to reach Sister Anne (their transportation) until morning_ and somewhat trapped by the German shepherds growling at the doorstep_ Mary Helen and Eileen are convinced by Sister Felicita to stay.

However_ when Laura_ the cook's assistant_ comes out threatening to quit_ the two nuns begin to realize St. Colette's will probably provide for a less than peaceful retreat! Out for a walk_ Sister Mary Helen has the unfortunate surprise of stumbling upon the body of Greg Johnson_ Laura's rebellious boyfriend and a former student of the priesthood. Realizing he's dead_ Mary Helen runs panting down the hill to get help. At first it looks like Greg fell_ but upon further examination it becomes clear that he was murdered. And the worst part of all is_ until policemen Little and Kemp uncover who did it_ Sergeant Loody considers all the people at the retreat suspects_ including Sister Mary Helen. No one is allowed to leave.

For once both suspect and sleuth_ Sister Mary Helen begins an investigation of her own. Moving slowly through the list of suspects_ she confronts all who knew Greg_ from Monsignor McHugh to Greg's mother_ Marva Johnson. Almost everyone had a beef with him. While Kate Murphy_ Sister Mary Helen's SFPD connection_ grapples with her reservations about moving from San Francisco to Marin County_ Mary Helen must decide in her own mind whether being a priest absolves a man from murder."
Death of an Angel,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives_Amateur,"It is a rainy Feast of All Souls and feisty Sister Mary Helen_ the Bay City's famous crime-fighting nun_ has nothing more on her mind than helping Angelica Bowers_ the troubled young woman who works in the library of Mount St. Francis College.  Unfortunately_ her plans are shattered when dear Gemma Burke_ one of her oldest friends_ becomes the latest victim of a serial rapist-murderer.

Sister Mary Helen realizes that the San Francisco police_ despite their furious protests_ need a little divine intervention- so she and her sidekick_ Sister Eileen_ set off after Gemma's killer.  But little do the devout detectives know that they are walking into an intricate web of evil woven by a cold-blooded killer..."
Death Takes Up a Collection,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives_Amateur,Monsignor Joseph Higgins liked_ along with wine and women_ the finer things in life--so much so that he may have dipped into the church funds to finance his good tastes. But would that be reason enough to kill the crooked clergyman? Someone had poisoned the pastor--and there was no shortage of likely suspects_ from his surly housekeeper to several prominent parishioners. Now Sister Mary Helen and Sister Eileen must delve into this sacrilegious slaying and bring a killer to justice.
Requiem at the Refuge,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives_Amateur,"In Sister Mary Helen's new outing as an inadvertent detective_ the elderly nun must make do without her even more elderly sidekick_ Sister Eileen. Eileen has gone back to Ireland to be with her dying sister_ so Mary Helen has no one with whom to share her fears when the head of St. Francis College dies suddenly and is replaced by the coldly efficient Sister Patricia. Surely_ Mary Helen feels_ she will be swept aside as too old in the ""clean sweep"" Patricia is famous for in the order.
To her rescue comes the much younger Sister Anne_ who runs the Refuge_ a shelter for homeless women. Although Anne doubts whether Mary Helen can deal with the kind of women who seek refuge there_ kindness leads her to ask the nun to volunteer at the center. And Anne quickly learns that the women's blue language_ gritty lifestyles_ and casual moral standards don't daunt the doughty old woman. Even though Mary Helen is saddened when a very young woman who frequented the center is found murdered in an alley behind the building_ her sympathy does not deter her from pursuing the clues she uncovers.
The homicide detectives assigned to the case_ Kate Murphy and Dennis Gallagher_ have dealt with Mary Helen before; now they are very firm about warning her to tend to her sisterly duties and let them do the investigating. Sister Mary Helen has been warned_ but that doesn't mean Sister Mary Helen has been stopped.
In this_ the ninth in Sister Carol Anne's series featuring the genuinely lovable_ independent_ and sensible Mary Helen_ readers will be happy to find that age doesn't seem to be slowing Mary Helen down a bit_ in spite of what Sister Patricia_ the Queen of the Clean Sweep_ may think. And don't the two homicide detectives wish that it would!"

Journalist Russell Hokes travels there to profile the brave and honest citizens who are struggling to save their community. Well_ sort of. Actually_ Wigfield is not so much a town as a series of ramshackle strip clubs and used-auto-parts stores_ lacking any kind of civic infrastructure whatsoever. And its people are not so much ""brave and honest"" as ""brutal_"" ""homicidal_"" and ""lacking any redeeming virtue whatsoever."" Similarly_ to call Hokes_ who narrates his own struggles to gather accumulate 50_000 words_ a ""journalist"" is at best an exaggeration and at worst an abomination against the institution of journalism itself.

The New Mystery: The International Association of Crime Writers Essential Crime Writing of the Late 20th Century,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Jorge Luis  Borges_Flannery  O'Connor_Angela  Carter,"In the last decade of this century_ crime writing has become a true international language_ bringing forth the world's best literary talents to create a fictional mirror of our fears_ our need for justice - or revenge - and our violent world. Since 1987_ the members of the International Association of Crime Writers have created a multinational ""brotherhood and sisterhood of crime"" to articulate a vision that the forty-two chilling stories in this definitive collection represent - fiction that pushes the genre of crime writing beyond its old limits to create a genuine literature for the modern age. James Ellroy_ Paco Ignacio Taibo II_ Andrew Vachss_ and Didier Daeninckx_ creators of stories that surpass the mere hard edge to depict a bloody_ pitiless world of criminals and avengers_ show us a violent urban no-man's land where the real danger is the loss of our souls.

Sue Grafton uses her PI Kinsey Millhone to balance the scales of justice in the shotgun killing of a cocaine dealer when the authorities can't_ or won't; Sara Paretsky brings back Philip Marlowe to solve a classic California case of double murder in a brilliant homage to Raymond Chandler. Clarice Lispector shows us the terrible tricks of a young English teacher protecting herself from rapists on a train ride to Rio; Don DeLillo slices close to the bone when he presents a sympathetic picture of a young Lee Harvey Oswald_ and so does Lawrence Block when he uses the victims of AIDS to pose a conundrum about the ethics of dying... and murder.

All forty-two stories in this extraordinary gathering of the ""new mystery"" represent crime writing that no longer follows the rules of yesterday's cozies and detective fiction. There is evil here_ but no sanitized murders off stage or in locked rooms. There is disturbingly realistic violence_ but no aloof_ emotionless paragons of deduction. Instead_ The New Mystery gives us vigorous_ stunning tales_ often ironic or deeply cynical and undeniably alive.

The Oxford Book of Detective Stories,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives_Arthur Conan  Doyle_Jorge Luis  Borges_Sara  Paretsky_Stuart M.  Kaminsky,"The Oxford Book of Detective Stories is a thorough_ broad_ and representative collection of short stories intended to reflect the best of detective fiction from around the world. Drawing on works dating from the middle 1800s up to the present_ editor Patricia Craig shows us how different nationalities have imposed their own stamp on this highly popular and relatively young literary genre. Alongside English and American fiction by such acknowledged masters as Ellery Queen_ Dashiell Hammett_ Erle Stanley Gardner_ and Agatha Christie_ we find stories by Georges Simenon_ Arthur Conan Doyle_ Sarah Paretsky_ and Ian Rankin. The anthology roams across Europe and further afield to embrace Japan_ Denmark_ Holland_ Italy_ Argentina_ Czechoslovakia_ and other countries. This is a book that will delight any fan or student of detective fiction. Women detectives_ police procedurals_ the amateur sleuth_ locked-room mysteries_ and the classic or pioneering models of the genre are all represented here--and in her perceptive and inclusive introduction Craig examines the figure of the detective in international literature.

Following the acclaimed debut work in this series_ Ravenmocker_ The Redbird's Cry solidifies the reputation of Jean Hager_ a veteran writer drawing upon a unique contemporary setting and featuring a resilient new heroine. 

It is autumn in Oklahoma. The woods are strewn with hackberry leaves_ and a chill is in the air. For Molly Bearpaw_ an investigator for the Native American Advocacy League_ it is a lovely time of year_ while for her elderly grandmother_ it is a time of foreboding. When a terrible crime is committed at the Cherokee National Museum_ it fulfills the old woman's worst premonitions and plunges Molly into a struggle for the truth. At the museum_ amidst looms and basket weavings_ a bright young lawyer is struck down in a crowd_ the victim of a poisoned dart. Is the killer a troubled teenager? If so_ was he the pawn of someone more powerful? Molly Bearpaw and Deputy D. J. Kennedy strongly suspect the involvement of the hot-headed leader of the True Echota Band_ a group involved in lawsuits against the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma.

Soon Molly is trying to solve not just a murder_ but a whole string of crimes. Then when priceless_ ancient wampum belts_ relics whose powers frighten many traditional Cherokees_ are stolen from the museum following the murder_ she is sure the murder was caused by something far greater than a personal vendetta."

The words were spoken by Zebediah Smoke_ whose ramshackle property bordered the Cherokee Nation's new_ half-completed bingo hall. Zeb's listeners_ his great-nephew and a retired professor who had come to record the old man's stories for posterity_ could dismiss his rantings as an old man's melodrama.

But in a matter of days Zeb's words seemed to come true. The first victim was found in his garage_ dead of carbon monoxide poisoning. While the sheriff wanted to rule it a suicide and close the case_ Molly Bearpaw_ whose own life had been darkened by suicide_ was sure that this was not. So was the teenage daughter of the dead man. And besides_ there was the matter of the seven small black stones left in a circle on the seat of Ed Whitekiller's pick-up truck. Whitekiller had been chronically unemployed and a perpetual womanizer. While Molly was suspicious of his angry wife_ and his latest lover's angry husband_ she couldn't shake the feeling that this was something other than a crime of passion. And when another dead man was found within shooting distance of Zebediah Smoke's shack_ she knew that seven black stones would be found there_ too. Now_ she only had to find out why..."
The Spirit Caller,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives,The past looms powerfully in the Cherokee Nation.

Molly Bearpaw_ recently appointed major crimes investigator_ is less than stunned when Talia is murdered.  There are plenty of suspects_ yet from Talia's hot-tempered ex-husband to the Nation's ruling medicine man_ the profiles don't quite fit.  Molly knows that someone hung Talia outside a building that was once a jailhouse in the violent days of the Territory.  What she cannot guess is how close to home the truth will be found- and what kind of crimes lurk not only in the past_ but among Molly's own flesh and blood...
The Grandfather Medicine,Fiction_Crime and Mystery_Detective Story and Detectives_Police Procedural,A homicide in Buckskin_ Oklahoma_ was guaranteed to overload the phone lines. Especially if the dead man was a Cherokee...found with two fingers severed from his hand.

A second murder leads him to an ancient medicine man and into the sacred ritual of Grandfather Medicine...as past and present clash in a violent swirl of coldhearted passions and the twisted mind of a killer.

Island in the Sea of Time,Fiction_Science Fiction_World Versions_Time Travel_Alternate Histories,"During a perfect spring evening on Nantucket a violent storm erupts and a dome of crawling_ colored fire blankets the island.  When the howling winds subside and the night skies clear_ the stars appear to have shifted.  The mainland has become a wilderness of unbroken forest_ where tools of bronze and stone litter the beaches_ and primitive natives scatter in terror.

A startling phenomenon has occurred: The island of Nantucket has been swept into the long-ago past.  With its inhabitants adrift in the year 1250 B.C._ there is only one question to be answered: Can they survive?"
Against the Tide of Years,Fiction_Science Fiction_World Versions_Alternate Histories,In the years since the Event_ the Republic of Nantucket has done its best to recreate the better ideas of the modern age.  But the evils of its time resurface in the person of William Walker_ renegade Coast Guard officer_ who is busy building an empire for himself based on conquest by technology.  When Walker reaches Greece and recruits several of their greater kinglets to his cause_ the people of Nantucket have no choice.  If they are to save the primitive world from being plunged into bloodshed on a twentieth-century scale_ they must defeat Walker at his own game: war.
The Moon and the Sun,Fiction_Fantasy_Historical,"In seventeenth-century France_ Louis XIV rules with flamboyant ambition. From the Hall of Mirrors to the vermin-infested attics of the Chateau at Versailles_ courtiers compete to please the king_ sacrificing fortune_ principles_ and even the sacred bond between brother and sister.
Marie-Josèphe de la Croix looks forward to assisting her adored brother in the scientific study of the rare sea monsters the king has commissioned him to seek. For the honor of his God_ his country_ and his king_ Father Yves de la Croix returns with his treasures_ believed to be the source of immortality: one heavy shroud packed in ice... and a covered basin that imprisons a shrieking creature.
The living sea monster_ with its double tail_ tangled hair_ and gargoyle face_ provides an intriguing experiment for Yves and the king. Yet for Marie-Josèphe_ the creature's gaze and exquisite singing foretell a different future...
Soon Marie-Josèphe is contemplating choices that defy the institutions which power her world. Somehow_ she must find the courage to follow her heart and her convictions -- even at the cost of changing her life forever."
Slow River,Fiction_Science Fiction_Gay & Lesbian_Lesbian,"Nicola Griffith_ winner of the Tiptree Award and the Lambda Award for her widely acclaimed first novel Ammonite_ now turns her attention closer to the present in Slow River_ the dark and intensely involving story of a young woman's struggle for survival and independence on the gritty underside of a near-future Europe.
She awoke in an alley to the splash of rain. She was naked_ a foot-long gash in her back was still bleeding_ and her identity implant was gone. Lore Van de Oest was the daughter of one of the world's most powerful families...and now she was nobody. 
Then out of the rain walked Spanner_ an expert data pirate who took her in_ cared for her wounds_ and gave her the freedom to reinvent herself again and again. No one could find Lore if she didn't want to be found: not the police_ not her family_ and not the kidnappers who had left her in that alley to die. She had escaped...but she paid for her newfound freedom in crime_ deception_ and degradation--over and over again. 
Lore had a choice: She could stay in the shadows_ stay with Spanner...and risk losing herself forever. Or she could leave Spanner and find herself again by becoming someone else: stealing the identity implant of a dead woman_ taking over her life_ and inventing her future.
But to start again_ Lore required Spanner's talents--Spanner_ who needed her and hated her_ and who always had a price. And even as Lore agreed to play Spanner's games one final time_ she found that there was still the price of being a Van de Oest to be paid. Only by confronting her past_ her family_ and her own demons could Lore meld together who she had once been_ who she had become_ and the person she intended to be....
In Slow River_ Nicola Griffith skillfully takes us deep into the mind and heart of her complex protagonist_ where the past must be reconciled with the present if the future is ever to offer solid ground. Slow River poses a question we all hope never to need to answer: Who are you when you have nothing left?"

It was the indifferent shrug and callous intertia that this 'optimism' concealed which so angered Voltaire_ who found the 'all for the best' approach a patently inadequate response to suffering_ to natural disasters - such as the recent earthquakes in Lima and Lisbon - not to mention the questions of illness and man-made war.  Moreover_ as the rebel whose satiric genius had earned him not only international acclaim_ but two stays in the Bastille_ flogging and exile_ Voltaire knew personally what suffering involved.

In Candide he whisks his young hero and friends through a ludicrious variety of tortures_ tragedies and reversals of fortune_ in the company of Pangloss_ a 'matapysico-theologo-cosmolo-nigologist' of unflinching optimism.  The result is one of the glories of the eighteenth-century satire."

Dinner at Deviant's Palace,Fiction_Science Fiction_Religion_Messianic_Bleak Futures_Nuclear Holocaust/Post-Apocalypse,"The civilized world had come to an end more than a century earlier_ but in California life and society went on...taking strange_ often horrifying forms.

Gregario Rivas was a survivor- a proud_ resourceful man who had_ most recently_ made his way from the corrupt_ crumbling city of Venice to carve out a successful career as a musician within the walls of Ellay. He played his pelican with raw energy and flashy style_ and people came from all over to hear him. But Greg's real claim to fame had nothing to do with music. It was part of his past he wanted to forget. And it had come back to haunt him...

A well-dressed old man stood at the bar watching the band play_ and it took a few moments between the time that Rivas first noticed him and the unpleasant spark of recognition. It was Irwin Barrows_ father of the girl Greg had loved some 13 years ago_ and longed for ever since. Urania.

Barrows hadn't been at all pleased at the relationship between his only child and a tenant farmer's son_ and he'd put an abrupt end to the romance- to the boy's everlasting humiliation. Yet Greg managed to remain outwardly cool as he wandered over to join the man_ well aware that there was only one possible reason for Irwin Barrows to seek him out.

It was Greg Rivas_ redeemer_ the old man wanted. For Urania had been recruited by the followers of self-proclaimed messiah Norton Jaybush. Outsiders knew very little about the cult- just stories of Jaybush's ""miracles"" and incredible powers of mind control... and the disturbing fact that once a convert entered the Holy City of Irvine_ he or she never returned. Grief-stricken families who could pay the price hired redeemers- contract kidnappers who would_ with luck_ bring lost sons and daughters home again before the cult's mysterious sacrament burned out their minds. Greg Rivas was the best. Because Greg had once been a Jaybird himself.

Rivas wanted to turn the job down. Life as a star was comfortable and lucarative; redemptions could be deadly. Why should he risk all for a man he hated_ or even a woman he had once loved? The memory of his Jaybird days was still vivid: the devastating shock of communion_ the messiah's methodical system of disassembling minds and consuming souls_ leaving only gibbering shells of humanity behind. Rivas had escaped_ yet freedom had led to another kind of hell. Venice_ city of sin and death_ where men and women too often succumbed to a killing addiction to the drug called Blood; where sickness_ fear and madness reigned_ and mutants of all kinds did their best to survive.

Barrows was desperate_ willing to pay an enormous fee_ but for Greg there was more than money at stake. Had he lost his nerve? Could he leave Urania to face the horror he had known? Even as he bartered_ Rivas knew he'd go.

But this was going to be his last redemption... one that would cost him his self respect and bits of his life_ slowly and agonizingly. It would lead him into both Jaybush's Holy City and the cruel heart of Venice- the infamous nightclub known as Deviant's Palace. And there he would discover the terrifying link between sin and salvation."
